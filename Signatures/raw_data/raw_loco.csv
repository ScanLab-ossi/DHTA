M113e9,04/09/2008,mainstream,"New study finds no link between measles vaccine and autism

New research further debunks any link between measles vaccine and autism, work that comes as the United States is experiencing a surge in measles cases fuelled by children left unvaccinated.

Years of research with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, better known as MMR, have concluded that it doesn't cause autism.

Still, some parents' fears persist, in part because of one 1998 British study that linked the vaccine with a subgroup of autistic children who also have serious gastrointestinal problems. That study reported that measles virus was lingering in the children's bowels.

Only now have researchers rigorously retested that finding, taking samples of youngsters' intestines to hunt for signs of virus with the most modern genetic technology. There is no evidence that MMR plays any role, the international team — which included researchers who first raised the issue — reported Wednesday.

""Although in fact there was evidence that this vaccine was safe in the bulk of the population, it had not been previously assessed with respect to kids with autism and GI complaints,"" said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, who led the work published in PLoS One, the online journal of the Public Library of Science.

""We are confident there is no link between MMR and autism,"" Lipkin said.

Added co-author Dr. Larry Pickering of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: ""I feel very certain that it is a safe vaccine.""

Measles, a highly infectious virus best known for its red skin rash, once routinely sickened thousands of children a year and killed hundreds, until childhood vaccinations made it a rarity in this country.

But so far this year, the U.S. has counted 131 measles cases, the most in a decade. Most patients were unvaccinated. Some were infants too young for their first MMR shot, but nearly half involved children whose parents rejected vaccination, the CDC reported last month.

No one knows just how many autism patients also suffer gastrointestinal disorders, pain that they may not be able to communicate. But Lipkin said that by some estimates, up to a quarter may be affected.

The MMR fear was that the vaccine's weakened measles virus somehow lodged in and inflamed intestines, allowing waste products to escape and reach the central nervous system, Lipkin said. So his team had two questions: Does measles virus really persist in children with both disorders and not other youngsters? And did vaccination precede the GI complaints which in turn preceded autism?

Researchers studied 25 children with both autism and GI disorders, and another 13 children with the same GI disorders but no neurologic problems. The youngsters — the average age was five — all were undergoing colonoscopies for their GI conditions anyway, allowing tissue samples to be tested for genetic traces of measles virus. All had been vaccinated at younger ages.

The tests uncovered traces of measles genetic material in the bowels of one boy with autism — and one boy without autism. That doesn't prove virus never temporarily lodged in more children, but it contradicts the earlier study that raised concern.

Nor was there a relationship with vaccine timing: Just five of the 25 autistic children had MMR precede GI complaints that in turn preceded autism symptoms.

Researchers consulted some prominent vaccine critics in designing the study. California advocate Rick Rollens praised the work but said it didn't eliminate other vaccine concerns that deserve similar study. Meanwhile, he said it should draw much-needed attention to the suffering of patients like his son, who has both autism and GI disorders.

""No longer can mainstream medicine ignore the parents' claims of significant GI distress,"" he said."

Just over a year ago, before the modern plague descended, Manhattan's Hudson Yards threw a launch party that was Versailles-like in its overabundance of champagne, oysters, top chefs, beautiful people and other trappings of a great city.

But on a recent afternoon, Hudson Yards was a ghost town. Its 1m-square-foot shopping mall was shuttered and its anchor tenant, Neiman Marcus, would soon declare bankruptcy. The Vessel public art sculpture — likened by one reviewer to a giant doner kebab, and usually teeming with tourists — was empty but for a security guard patrolling its base.

The only foot traffic was a steady stream of soldiers, who had been treating Covid-19 patients at the hastily-erected field hospital at the nearby Javits convention centre. They were lined up, at six-foot intervals, to collect free meals at a Hudson Yards storefront that had been converted into a soup kitchen. Alongside them were delivery drivers, postal workers, office cleaners and others manning the frontlines in New York City’s struggle against coronavirus.

The tableau is a reminder of how drastically the virus has transformed New York, which has potentially suffered more deaths than any other city in the world, in just a matter of weeks. As New Yorkers inch towards a reopening, probably next month, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio, they are contemplating with trepidation how their city will emerge from the pandemic — and what sort of future it will find on the other side.

More than other large cities, New York exemplifies the urban characteristics that the virus has turned into vulnerabilities — population density, sky-high cost of living, a reliance on retail, culture and tourism and a dependence on crowded public transport.

The modern history of New York City is one of periodic disasters shadowed by the fear of exodus — to other cities that are cheaper, safer, more convenient. There was the 1970s fiscal crisis and the decay that followed; the 1987 stock market crash; the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks; and the 2008 financial crisis — not to mention various hurricanes, floods and power failures.

Yet in each case the doomsayers were proved wrong. The city bounced back stronger than before, and in some ways, reinvented itself. September 11, for example, gave rise to a more vibrant downtown and set in motion Hudson Yards, a $25bn development that is North America’s largest. After 2008, the world’s financial capital morphed into a technology hub to rival Silicon Valley and strengthened its magnetic pull on a new generation of talent.

“No one is working in New York because it’s cheaper or easier. Nobody. It’s because the talent is here,” says Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive for the tri-state area at CBRE, the real estate services group.

Carl Weisbrod, a veteran of city government who led the revival of Times Square in the late 1980s under Ed Koch and was recently appointed by Mr de Blasio to a new task force to guide the city’s recovery, acknowledges that the next 18 months will be difficult. But he concludes that “as long as New York holds on to its talent, I have no doubt whatsoever that, as an economic matter, it will recover”.

Other civic leaders tend to echo that reflexive faith in New York’s future. Some even talk about a unique opportunity to reimagine the city — to clear away nettlesome business regulation built up over generations, attract new industries, or correct the social inequities exposed by the crisis.

As Mr de Blasio said recently: “If ever there was a moment, a breakpoint moment, in the city’s history, this is it. It’s time to look anew at everything we do and see what works, what doesn’t work.”

Before New York can set about reinventing itself there is uncertainty, even among its most ardent supporters, as to how the city will bridge the immediate catastrophe. Many are plagued by a troubling sense that this time is different.

“This is much more complicated,” says Carol Kellermann, who ran the charitable fund created after the September 11 terror attack and also led the Citizens Budget Commission advisory group. “I think it’s going to have much deeper, longer-lasting impacts.”

September 11 was brutal and devastating but the world rallied around the city and its economy resumed within days. After 2008, New York City ended up benefiting from policies that pumped vast sums of liquidity into the financial system.

With coronavirus, there is no quick fix in sight. The city’s morgues are overflowing after more than 21,000 fatalities — roughly eight times the city’s toll from the 9/11 attacks — and some are forecasting unemployment will rise to 20 per cent in June. Yet the city is arousing less sympathy from the nation than partisan resentment. New York feels alone.

Worst of all, the very thing that distinguishes New York City and accounts for its unique alchemy — its density — is what makes it so vulnerable to the pandemic. “Other than better treatments and a vaccine, I don’t know that there’s any government policy that can make people feel safer,” Ms Kellermann says.

Those with the means have left, quarantining in places such as the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Aspen. How many will have gone for good, she wonders, if the city’s cultural life is effectively closed and therefore unable to offset its high taxes and other indignities.

“There’s definitely going to be urban flight,” says Winston Fisher, a third-generation developer, who voiced an ever-present fear among New Yorkers of a certain vintage about a reversion to the bad old days. “I grew up in the city. I’ve been robbed at gunpoint. I remember what 59th and 6th used to look like, Times Square,” he recalls. “New York City can be bad. Don’t forget that.”

To prevent that, there is an emerging consensus that authorities must create a sense of safety, just as they managed to do after September 11. Otherwise, it will be impossible to restore business — let alone bring back tourists. It is a public health challenge but also a psychological one.

In the absence of a vaccine, the governor of New York state, Andrew Cuomo, has turned to former mayor Michael Bloomberg to spearhead a testing and tracing system. The hope is that as the city begins to reopen, the testers will be able to quickly find new infections and seal them off before they become outbreaks. As Mr Cuomo readily acknowledges, it is a huge undertaking.

Meanwhile, developers are rushing to refit office buildings that had been designed to accommodate a taste for ever-increasing density. Elevators are being reprogrammed to respond to smartphone apps so there is no need for passengers to touch a button. Internal doors are being removed for the same purpose.

A critical focus in this decontamination is the world’s biggest — and possibly most blighted — underground system. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has begun a regime that would have been unimaginable just a few months ago: to scrub and disinfect each subway car and station every single day.

“New York City and the MTA are fundamentally built on density. That density creates intellectual collaboration and culture and business and Wall Street and finance and design,” says Pat Foye, the MTA chairman, explaining the subway’s essential role as the circulatory system for a global metropolis.

Mr Foye predicts that new cleaning technologies “could be real game-changers in terms of public confidence in the system”. But cleanliness will come at a cost: he estimates “hundreds of millions of dollars” in additional expense at a time when ridership and fare revenue are down by more than 90 per cent.

The MTA has received $3.9bn in emergency funding from the federal government and is already pleading for another $3.9bn infusion just to make it through this year.

That is but one example of the fiscal challenges now lurking at every turn. Mr de Blasio, whose administration has added 30,000 workers to the city’s payroll since he took office in 2014, has estimated the budget shortfall caused by the virus shutdown at $7.4bn. Others have put it closer to $10bn.

Whatever the figure, Seth Pinsky, who led economic development during the Bloomberg administration, worries that it may pose the most direct threat to a virtuous circle in which talent and companies have chased each other to the city.

“The key to New York’s success over the last 20-plus years has been the first-class workforce it has been able to attract,” says Mr Pinsky, who recently took over as head of 92nd Street Y, one of the city’s leading cultural institutions. “What I worry about is that as government starts to react to the fiscal situation we are going to be forced to make cuts to basic services that are going to be so devastating that they will undermine the quality of life in the city.”

Finding ways to preserve restaurants, museums, galleries and the like is not just “having a soft spot for arts and culture”, Mr Pinsky says. Rather, it is essential to maintain the appeal — and viability — of an otherwise expensive and challenging place to live.

When Donald Trump was elected president, some New Yorkers consoled themselves that he was, at least, one of them, and could therefore be counted on to look out for the city’s interests. But his sustained hostility to the city that voted overwhelmingly against him in 2016 is dimming hopes for federal support.

Mr Trump’s 2017 tax cut was largely paid for by punishing New York and other, Democratic-leaning high-tax states. Even if Mr Trump were inclined to help, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has dismissed pleas for coronavirus aid as “blue-state bailouts”.

After September 11, Mr Bloomberg responded to the downturn by raising property taxes, a stream of revenue that accounts for nearly a third of New York City’s $89bn budget. But that trick will not be easily repeated.

Developers may be in no position to shoulder a heavier financial burden at a time when many of their own tenants have stopped paying rent. They are also confronting a larger fear: after a crash course in remote working, some of the city’s biggest employers — including BlackRock and Morgan Stanley — have announced that they will require less office space in the future. If that conclusion is widespread, then Manhattan property values may be headed for a reckoning.

Even before coronavirus, the wealthy were beginning to flee the city’s rising taxes for places such as Florida and Texas. “People are leaving New York and they’re leaving New York in droves,” says Norman Radow, a one-time New York developer who is now based in Atlanta. The coronavirus, he adds, “is just the icing on the cake”.

Still, Mr Radow’s own experience made him wonder if there might be investment opportunities ahead. He first moved to Manhattan in 1978, the depths of the fiscal crisis, and bought a two-bedroom apartment for $63,000. “Everyone thought it was the end of New York,” he recalls. “And look what happened.”

Amid the wreckage there are shards of hope. Some are warming to the possibility that a city that became so overheated in this cheap-money era — a bastion of billionaires, ensconced in Hudson Yards — might now undergo a pandemic-induced reset. Cheaper rents may eventually make the city more accessible for a new generation, who will put spaces to use in ways their elders can scarcely imagine.

“It always happens after every crisis. It seeds the next phase,” says Daniel Kaplan, senior partner at architecture firm FXCollaborative. WeWork, Mr Kaplan notes, was born from the unused office space left in the wake of the 2008 crisis.

Ms Kellermann agrees: “My daughter, who’s 35, says it’s going to go back to what it was in the ‘70s and ‘80s — grittier, but more risk-takers.” (She acknowledges that her daughter had not actually experienced New York in the 1970s — a time when the annual murder rate breached 2,000 and the subway was off-limits after nightfall.)

Mr Fisher now sees a rare chance to streamline an antiquated city government and improve the flow of credit to small businesses. Like other members of the business community, he would also like the city to prioritise the life sciences industry as a next source of high-paying jobs — just as the Bloomberg administration cultivated the tech sector.

Even with Amazon’s decision last year to cancel plans for a second headquarters in Queens, New York City has still managed to attract billions of dollars in investment from the online retailer, as well as Facebook and Google, that have shined and reshaped the city’s west side, including Hudson Yards.

Mr Weisbrod wants to build more affordable housing. “I think the pendulum has swung way too far against development,” he says. “Everybody says they want more affordable housing but nobody wants it in their neighbourhood.”

With coronavirus prying open the public’s eyes to the disparities between rich and poor, there may be the chance. At the same time, Mr Weisbrod and other civic leaders worry how the crisis will eventually shape the city’s politics. Will it be a constructive force that brings reform — or a divisive one that ultimately pits communities against one another?

The race next year to succeed Mr de Blasio as mayor may be one of the most consequential campaigns in the city’s modern history. Will his successor be another self-described “progressive” or a member of the executive class, in the mould of Mr Bloomberg — or something else entirely? Whoever prevails should have faith in New York’s resilience but also, as Mr Pinsky warns, not forget its darker days.

“Those were ugly times,” he says of the 1970s, when New York City’s economic base was wrecked and its population shrank by 800,000 residents. “It took us decades to crawl out of that hole. We should be very careful about not falling back in.”

M0826e,21/04/2005,mainstream,"In two earlier columns on Europe’s database directive, and European public information, I pointed out that our policy-process is almost evidence-free. New rights are created on the basis of anecdote and scaremongering. There are other examples and they are not confined to Europe.

Thomas Macaulay told us copyright law is a tax on readers for the benefit of writers, a tax that shouldn’t last a day longer than necessary. What do we do? We extend the copyright term repeatedly on both sides of the Atlantic. The US goes from fourteen years to the author’s life plus seventy years. We extend protection retrospectively to dead authors, perhaps in the hope they will write from their tombs.

Since only about 4 per cent of copyrighted works more than 20 years old are commercially available, this locks up 96 per cent of 20th century culture to benefit 4 per cent. The harm to the public is huge, the benefit to authors, tiny. In any other field, the officials responsible would be fired. Not here.

It is as if we had signed an international stupidity pact, one that required us to ignore the evidence, to hand out new rights without asking for the simplest assessment of need. If the stakes were trivial, no one would care. But intellectual property (IP) is important. These are the ground rules of the information society. Mistakes hurt us. They have costs to free speech, competition, innovation, and science. Why are we making them?

To some the answer is obvious: corporate capture of the decision making process. This is a nicely cynical conclusion. But wait. There are economic interests on both sides. The film and music industries are tiny compared the consumer electronics industry. Yet copyright law dances to the tune played by the former, not the latter. Open source software is big business. But the international IP bureaucracies seem to view it as godless communism.

If money talks, why can decision-makers only hear one side of the conversation? Corporate capture can only be part of the explanation. Something more is needed. We need to deconstruct the culture of IP stupidity, to understand it so we can change it. But this is a rich and complex stupidity, like a fine Margaux. I can only review a few flavours.

Maximalism: The first thing to realize is that many decisions are driven by honest delusion, not corporate corruption. The delusion is maximalism: the more intellectual property rights we create, the more innovation. This is clearly wrong; rights raise the cost of innovation inputs (lines of code, gene sequences, data.) Do their monopolistic and anti-competitive effects outweigh their incentive effects? That’s the central question, but many of our decision makers seem never to have thought of it.

The point was made by an exchange inside the Committee that shaped Europe’s ill-starred Database Directive. It was observed that the US, with no significant property rights over unoriginal compilations of data, had a much larger database industry than Europe which already had significant “sweat of the brow” protection in some countries. Europe has strong rights, the US weak. The US is winning.

Did this lead the committee to wonder for a moment whether Europe should weaken its rights? No. Their response was that this showed we had to make the European rights much stronger. The closed-mindedness is remarkable. “That man eats only a little salad and looks slim. Clearly to look as good as him, we have to eat twice as much, and doughnuts too!”

Authorial Romance: Part of the delusion depends on the idea that inventors and artists create from nothing. Who needs a public domain of accessible material if one can create out of thin air? But in most cases this simply isn’t true; artists, scientists and technologists build on the past. How would the blues, jazz, Elizabethan theatre, or Silicon valley have developed if they had been forced to play under today’s rules? Don’t believe me? Ask a documentary filmmaker about clearances, or a free-software developer about software patents.

An Industry Contract: Who are the subjects of IP? They used to be companies. You needed a printing press or a factory to trigger the landmines of IP. The law was set up as a contract between industry groups. This was a cosy arrangement, but it is no longer viable. The citizen-publishers of cyberspace, the makers of free software, the scientists of distributed data-analysis are all now implicated in the IP world. The decision-making structure has yet to adjust.

There are many more themes. The idea that greater control, for example, is always better (see my column on public data) or the way we only ever internationally harmonize rights upward. Fundamentally, though, the views I have criticised here are not merely stupidity. They constitute an ideology, a worldview, like flat earth-ism. But the world is not flat and the stupidity pact is not what we want to sign.

Let me be clear. IP is a good thing. (There are also important strands I have not discussed, such as natural rights and the droits d’auteur. They will get their own column.) Not all proposals to extend rights are silly, but if we do not start looking rigorously at evidence, we will never know which.

At my university, we set up The Center for the Study of the Public Domain to study the contributions of the public domain to creativity. We found we were the only such academic centre in the world. At first that made us feel innovative. Later it made us worried. If we don’t look at the evidence and we ignore the role of the public domain in fostering innovation, how can we possibly hope to make good policy?

M0d586,01/04/2020,mainstream,"Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story

The imperative to “test, test, test” has become a slogan of the coronavirus pandemic since it was voiced last month by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization. But the simple goal continues to elude even well-off countries that are struggling to track the spread of the virus among their populations.

Germany and South Korea have led the way in rolling out tests on a large scale, but the UK and US have been laggards. The greater the delays, the more prolonged the uncertainty over the size of the virus threat. As hunger for diagnosis grows, as testing kits are rejected and impatience with government mounts, we look at the available technologies, their potential and limitations.

What tests are available for coronavirus infection?

There are two main types. The first, an antigen test, detects the presence or absence in the body of the new coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19. The second, an antibody test, looks for signs that someone has been infected in the past by searching for an immune response.

Since Chinese scientists in mid-January published the full genetic code of the virus — officially known as Sars-CoV-2 — laboratories anywhere in the world have been able to use antigen testing to identify its genes in samples from patients. They use a procedure called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that has been standard practice in labs for 30 years.

PCR samples can come from several different sites in the patient. Simplest is the nasal swab taken from well inside the nose. The back of the throat is another option. For patients in hospital, a sample from the lower respiratory tract may give the best results. Antigen testing reveals whether someone has a current infection and could therefore pass Covid-19 on to others.

In contrast, antibody (or serological) tests work on blood samples to detect the immunity conferred by past infection. The test kits use proteins from the virus as “glue” to trap antibodies present in blood, said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology at the University of Edinburgh.

A finger prick should provide enough blood to detect two types of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2. The first, IgM antibodies, are shortlived and may indicate that the virus is still present. They usually disappear a couple of weeks after infection. In their place emerge a second more durable type, IgG antibodies. No one knows yet how long these will last and provide resistance to reinfection — anything from a few months to a few years seems possible.

Antibody tests are being prioritised by governments including the UK and Germany because they will be essential to informing individuals whether they can return to mixing safely in society without passing on or picking up infection. When carried out in a representative sample of the population, they will also answer key epidemiological questions — including about how many people were infected with mild or no symptoms.

Once developed, antibody tests should give results more quickly than traditional PCR tests, taking a few minutes rather than a few hours, though much faster antigen kits are under development.

When health authorities began to realise that the coronavirus outbreak might pose a global threat, they started developing tests in government labs such as those operated by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Public Health England, which already had ample experience in using PCR technology for diagnostics.

Traditionally, antigen diagnosis is done mostly in the public sector, with private companies providing test components such as chemical reagents and swabs for patient samples — some of which have been in short supply. But in recent weeks there has been a huge mobilisation of private sector resources as businesses around the world race to enter a rapidly expanding market, rolling out automated PCR kits that process samples much more quickly than conventional labs.

New antigen tests are relatively easy to create because “the PCR test is a small addition to an existing test”, said James Gill, clinical lecturer at Warwick Medical School.

But antibody tests take longer to develop because they have to be created from scratch. “You’ve had to physically get patient blood, find the antibodies in that blood (molecules smaller than the virus), create a reproducible antibody in the lab, and then create a reagent test that will react in the presence of that antibody — which can be read by health teams,” said Dr Gill.

The private sector has played an outsized role in the development and manufacturing of antibody tests, though its products still have to be validated by public health authorities before use.

The presence of Chinese companies has stood out in the effort to boost the supply of both types of test. Of 202 companies around the world producing commercialised Covid-19 test kits, 92 are from China, where the outbreak originated and an innovative medical technology sector is thriving.

According to data from the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (Find), a Geneva-based non-profit group that tracks product development, the second-largest number of coronavirus testing companies is in the US, which has 29.

Find’s list is not exhaustive and does not include some major players that have not sought to appear. Among them are Nasdaq-listed Hologic, whose test the US Food and Drug Administration has authorised for emergency use.

Beyond conventional antibody and antigen tests, researchers in universities and biotech companies are developing imaginative new diagnostic technologies. For instance Crispr, a gene editing technique that has taken the biotech world by storm, can be adapted to recognise and cut specific genetic sequences in Sars-CoV-2, which can then be identified via colour changes.

How fast are tests being rolled out?

Very unevenly — and not fast enough in many countries. Although there is no official centralised database, Find has collated data that indicates a cumulative total of more than 4.9m tests had been carried out worldwide by March 29. But that figure excludes China because the group could only obtain reliable data for one Chinese province.

South Korea, the country that got going first with extensive Covid-19 testing, has so far carried out 394,000 (equivalent to 770 per 100,000 people). Iceland has done 4,160 tests per 100,000.

The US was very slow to get started, because the CDC’s first test did not work well, so it had to go back to the drawing board to create a new one. It was then slow to allow other labs to test for Covid-19. But over the past two weeks US has ramped up testing rapidly.

Among larger European countries, the champion seems to be Germany, where public health officials have estimated that laboratories are carrying out as many as 500,000 coronavirus tests a week. Though official data has yet to confirm that number, it suggests that testing capacity has expanded fast in recent weeks. Germany’s decentralised test and laboratory infrastructure means the work is carried out not just in hospitals and doctors' practices but also in special drive-in stations.

Manufacturers are ready to supply the world with many millions of antibody tests, but health authorities and regulators are still evaluating their accuracy before allowing them to be rolled out widely. Last week Matt Hancock, UK health secretary, announced that the country had ordered 3.5m antibody test kits from various manufacturers.

How reliable are the tests?

The PCR test is extremely accurate when carried out carefully by experienced technicians in a well-equipped lab. Because it specifically detects genes found only in the Sars-CoV-2 virus, it will produce very few false positives, said Andrew Preston, reader in microbial pathogenesis at the University of Bath.

False negatives — which indicate wrongly that someone is clear of infection — are more of a problem. They often result from problems with collecting and processing patient samples. For other viruses, false negative rates of 10 per cent are widely accepted and they can reach as high as 30 per cent. Therefore PCR tests “have more often been used to confirm an infection rather than give someone the all clear”, said Dr Gill at Warwick Medical School.

The accuracy and reliability of the new antibody tests will not be known until they have been validated and technicians have gained more operating experience.

Spain’s ministry of health last week withdrew 8,000 Chinese-made testing kits delivered to Madrid’s regional government because of worries about inaccurate results. But the manufacturer Shenzhen Bioeasy said the problems may have been because of incorrect sample collection or use of the product.

Dr Preston said: “It is not easy to quickly and massively ramp up testing capacity when it requires both high-quality kits and properly trained staff.”"

In 2006, Ms Hollender co-authored a book called Naturally Clean: The Seventh Generation Guide to Safe and Healthy Non-Toxic Cleaning. In 2013, she completed her MBA course, specialising in social impact and sustainability.

1. What is your biggest lesson learnt?

Business school was the first time I really went outside my comfort zone. I applied to be the president of the social enterprise association and decided to start Sustain. I learnt that pushing yourself beyond what’s comfortable is critical to evolving personally and professionally.

Stern helped because it pushed me to explore what I really wanted to do. While there, I worked in sustainability at Johnson & Johnson, where I was surrounded by all these incredible entrepreneurs who encouraged me to create change on my own. It just so happened that at the time my father Jeffrey Hollender began writing the business plan for Sustain. He came to me for advice and I became more and more interested in it.

2. How have you developed your idea for Sustain?

When we started Sustain, we learnt there were 20m women in the US who lacked access to reproductive healthcare and family planning services. We also discovered that 1 in 4 female college freshmen contract an STD in their first year. Overall, there are 19 million STIs contracted in the US every year and 50 per cent of pregnancies are unplanned.

We knew that Sustain alone couldn’t move the needle quickly enough to address these critical issues, and therefore we created a separate part of the company called 10%4Women. This initiative donates 10 per cent of our pre-tax profits to places like Planned Parenthood, an organisation that has been addressing these issues for decades.

3. Why did you choose to attend NYU Stern?

When I was deciding which business school to attend, I went to an NYU event, where I heard the dean Peter Henry speak. He talked about transforming the school to prepare students to think about how to use business to address the social and economic issues our world faces, and this resonated with me. Although Stern was not known for being the most progressive and socially innovative school, I wanted to be part of it’s evolution.

4. What is your favourite memory of business school?

Running the school’s social enterprise association. I had never been in charge of an organisation before and as co-president I learnt what it was like. This included how to prepare for and run a board meeting, and how to ensure the school continued to fund us each semester.

5. What did you find the most difficult?

Figuring out what I wanted to do next. When you enter business school you’re presented with two ‘tracks’: one track is going through the processes of preparing for jobs in ‘traditional’ industries like finance, brand management, consulting, and the second track is to do something like fashion, entrepreneurship, media, etc. The first track is attractive because there is a structure in place. If you follow the steps, you will get a lucrative job. Unfortunately, many business schools have failed to make the second track more alluring and so students (like myself) struggle to figure out what they really want to do versus what they feel like they should do.

6. What were the gender dynamics like?

My class was 40 per cent female, so I really didn’t feel like I was in a ‘boys club.’ Also, a handful of my professors were women.

7. How do you deal with male dominated environments?

By not letting my mindset change. Recently, I spent 10 days alone at our factory in southern India. I was the only woman on site except for the women preparing lunch in the kitchen. I could have gone into that situation acting timid, or expecting that our business partners wouldn’t listen to what I had to say, but I decided before getting on the plane that I would not have that mindset.

8. Who is your ideal professor?

Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood. On top of being a female business leader in a male-dominated world, she also runs an organisation that addresses issues that people in the country don’t want to talk about. Even among backlash and criticism, she is incredibly strong and brave, not letting anyone impede her mission. She really is a huge inspiration.

9. What is your favourite business book?

The Responsibility Revolution: How the Next Generation of Businesses Will Win by Bill Breen and my father: “When we bring a higher level of consciousness to our work, good things tend to follow.”

10. What are your top tips for networking?

Before I got to business school, I was not great at networking. What I quickly learnt is that women like helping other women. I think it comes from typically being the underdogs in the business world.

Slowly, we are proving that we are just as, if not more, capable than our male peers, and a lot of this is happening because women are banding together. So be bold, ask the right questions, do you homework, and I think you’ll find that people are usually willing to help."
M12fbb,16/06/2020,mainstream,"Only a fool breaks the two-metre rule. This has been the mantra in the UK, where painted pavements and supermarket signage urge people to stay two metres apart to prevent coronavirus infection.

The rule is now under review in the UK, to the relief of ministers and business people who foresee a bleak future for a hospitality and entertainment industry that is currently without a critical mass of customers. They favour the World Health Organization’s one-metre recommendation, which has already been adopted by China, Hong Kong and Denmark. A decision is due in early July, when more sectors of the British economy are scheduled to reopen.

The fixation on distance usefully highlights a persistent theme in the public discussion of risk: a false, binary distinction between safety and danger. No magic attaches to either distance: some countries, including Australia, Belgium and Germany, have opted for one and a half metres.

The choice is not whether to be safe at two metres or unsafe at one — but whether we want to take more risk or less, and to what end. Reopening the economy before the virus is conquered means governments taking tough decisions on how society should function in a landscape of uncertain risk.

Uncertainty should not, however, mean junking the precautionary principle, given that Covid-19 is still springing unwelcome health surprises. For example, since we know some people can carry the virus without showing symptoms, we must assume they can also transmit it until proven otherwise.

This is the most convincing argument for donning face coverings or masks, especially indoors and on public transport, where distancing can be difficult. It is, mostly, an act of consideration towards others: face coverings prevent the projection of virus-laden droplets towards people and surfaces, where others can pick them up (the WHO recommends fabric coverings made of three layers of different materials, rather than medical masks).

Face coverings might also be important given the continuing disagreement over airborne transmission (via aerosol particles that are finer than the droplets emitted in coughs and sneezes and which can hang in the air for longer). A highly contested paper published last week suggested that such transmission was not only likely but dominant. Still, it is worth noting the pro-mask attitude in countries that have kept infection rates relatively low: there is no shame in copying measures for which there seems to be a rationale.

When it comes to social distancing, timing as well as distance is critical. Spending six seconds at one metre from an infected person carries roughly the same transmission risk as spending a minute at two metres, according to Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser to the UK government. The risk continues to fall with distance.

Outside is safer than inside because breezes disperse droplets and aerosols. Superspreading events have mostly been documented indoors — such as in nightclubs, gyms and churches (shouting, heavy breathing and singing all propel droplets further). Avoiding indoor meetings also cuts the chance that an infected visitor will leave traces of virus on surfaces for others to pick up.

These precautions, and others, matter because, in order to infect someone, the virus must physically enter the body via the mouth, nose or eyes. Every mandate or recommendation — including social distancing, face coverings, meeting outdoors, indoor ventilation, handwashing, cough etiquette — is designed to cut the chances of that happening. While public discussions tend to fixate on them singly, they are meant to be applied together — and in conjunction with a strong disease surveillance system to detect new outbreaks.

Still, the resurgence of the virus in Beijing, which had gone 50 days without a new case, is also a portent that we will be living amid uncertainty for many months to come. Until a vaccine arrives, deciding whether to shrink social distancing to expand the economy will be just one of many imperfect risk calculations on the table."
M1a562,08/03/2019,mainstream,"Too many organisations in global health are failing to address imbalances in pay and leadership and doing too little to tackle sexual harassment of women, who make up 70 per cent of the workforce.

That is the conclusion of Global Health 50/50's annual audit of gender inequality. The greatest discrepancies are at the top: seven out of ten executive heads and board chairs are men. They also earn 13.5 per cent more.

“The global health sector stands for fairness and universality, and strives to ensure health for everyone, particularly the most marginalised . . . If there is one sector that should set precedent in this space, it is global health,” says Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand prime minister, introducing the report.

Other reports marking International Women's Day catalogued problems facing women outside the workplace, from the “forgotten emergency” of unsafe abortion — one of the main causes of maternal mortality — to stigmas around menstruation. “Menstruating girls can even be banished to outside sheds where they suffer in cold and isolation, often at risk of illness and animal attacks,” UN experts said.

Despite some positive contributions — such as the UK's commitment to end global “period poverty” by 2030 — there is still a long way to go before women across the world have the rights to control their own bodies, including sexual and reproductive rights, without interference.
