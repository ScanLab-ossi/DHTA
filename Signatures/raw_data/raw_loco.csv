M113e9,04/09/2008,mainstream,"New study finds no link between measles vaccine and autism

New research further debunks any link between measles vaccine and autism, work that comes as the United States is experiencing a surge in measles cases fuelled by children left unvaccinated.

Years of research with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, better known as MMR, have concluded that it doesn't cause autism.

Still, some parents' fears persist, in part because of one 1998 British study that linked the vaccine with a subgroup of autistic children who also have serious gastrointestinal problems. That study reported that measles virus was lingering in the children's bowels.

Only now have researchers rigorously retested that finding, taking samples of youngsters' intestines to hunt for signs of virus with the most modern genetic technology. There is no evidence that MMR plays any role, the international team — which included researchers who first raised the issue — reported Wednesday.

""Although in fact there was evidence that this vaccine was safe in the bulk of the population, it had not been previously assessed with respect to kids with autism and GI complaints,"" said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, who led the work published in PLoS One, the online journal of the Public Library of Science.

""We are confident there is no link between MMR and autism,"" Lipkin said.

Added co-author Dr. Larry Pickering of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: ""I feel very certain that it is a safe vaccine.""

Measles, a highly infectious virus best known for its red skin rash, once routinely sickened thousands of children a year and killed hundreds, until childhood vaccinations made it a rarity in this country.

But so far this year, the U.S. has counted 131 measles cases, the most in a decade. Most patients were unvaccinated. Some were infants too young for their first MMR shot, but nearly half involved children whose parents rejected vaccination, the CDC reported last month.

No one knows just how many autism patients also suffer gastrointestinal disorders, pain that they may not be able to communicate. But Lipkin said that by some estimates, up to a quarter may be affected.

The MMR fear was that the vaccine's weakened measles virus somehow lodged in and inflamed intestines, allowing waste products to escape and reach the central nervous system, Lipkin said. So his team had two questions: Does measles virus really persist in children with both disorders and not other youngsters? And did vaccination precede the GI complaints which in turn preceded autism?

Researchers studied 25 children with both autism and GI disorders, and another 13 children with the same GI disorders but no neurologic problems. The youngsters — the average age was five — all were undergoing colonoscopies for their GI conditions anyway, allowing tissue samples to be tested for genetic traces of measles virus. All had been vaccinated at younger ages.

The tests uncovered traces of measles genetic material in the bowels of one boy with autism — and one boy without autism. That doesn't prove virus never temporarily lodged in more children, but it contradicts the earlier study that raised concern.

Nor was there a relationship with vaccine timing: Just five of the 25 autistic children had MMR precede GI complaints that in turn preceded autism symptoms.

Researchers consulted some prominent vaccine critics in designing the study. California advocate Rick Rollens praised the work but said it didn't eliminate other vaccine concerns that deserve similar study. Meanwhile, he said it should draw much-needed attention to the suffering of patients like his son, who has both autism and GI disorders.

""No longer can mainstream medicine ignore the parents' claims of significant GI distress,"" he said."

Just over a year ago, before the modern plague descended, Manhattan's Hudson Yards threw a launch party that was Versailles-like in its overabundance of champagne, oysters, top chefs, beautiful people and other trappings of a great city.

But on a recent afternoon, Hudson Yards was a ghost town. Its 1m-square-foot shopping mall was shuttered and its anchor tenant, Neiman Marcus, would soon declare bankruptcy. The Vessel public art sculpture — likened by one reviewer to a giant doner kebab, and usually teeming with tourists — was empty but for a security guard patrolling its base.

The only foot traffic was a steady stream of soldiers, who had been treating Covid-19 patients at the hastily-erected field hospital at the nearby Javits convention centre. They were lined up, at six-foot intervals, to collect free meals at a Hudson Yards storefront that had been converted into a soup kitchen. Alongside them were delivery drivers, postal workers, office cleaners and others manning the frontlines in New York City’s struggle against coronavirus.

The tableau is a reminder of how drastically the virus has transformed New York, which has potentially suffered more deaths than any other city in the world, in just a matter of weeks. As New Yorkers inch towards a reopening, probably next month, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio, they are contemplating with trepidation how their city will emerge from the pandemic — and what sort of future it will find on the other side.

More than other large cities, New York exemplifies the urban characteristics that the virus has turned into vulnerabilities — population density, sky-high cost of living, a reliance on retail, culture and tourism and a dependence on crowded public transport.

The modern history of New York City is one of periodic disasters shadowed by the fear of exodus — to other cities that are cheaper, safer, more convenient. There was the 1970s fiscal crisis and the decay that followed; the 1987 stock market crash; the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks; and the 2008 financial crisis — not to mention various hurricanes, floods and power failures.

Yet in each case the doomsayers were proved wrong. The city bounced back stronger than before, and in some ways, reinvented itself. September 11, for example, gave rise to a more vibrant downtown and set in motion Hudson Yards, a $25bn development that is North America’s largest. After 2008, the world’s financial capital morphed into a technology hub to rival Silicon Valley and strengthened its magnetic pull on a new generation of talent.

“No one is working in New York because it’s cheaper or easier. Nobody. It’s because the talent is here,” says Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive for the tri-state area at CBRE, the real estate services group.

Carl Weisbrod, a veteran of city government who led the revival of Times Square in the late 1980s under Ed Koch and was recently appointed by Mr de Blasio to a new task force to guide the city’s recovery, acknowledges that the next 18 months will be difficult. But he concludes that “as long as New York holds on to its talent, I have no doubt whatsoever that, as an economic matter, it will recover”.

Other civic leaders tend to echo that reflexive faith in New York’s future. Some even talk about a unique opportunity to reimagine the city — to clear away nettlesome business regulation built up over generations, attract new industries, or correct the social inequities exposed by the crisis.

As Mr de Blasio said recently: “If ever there was a moment, a breakpoint moment, in the city’s history, this is it. It’s time to look anew at everything we do and see what works, what doesn’t work.”

Before New York can set about reinventing itself there is uncertainty, even among its most ardent supporters, as to how the city will bridge the immediate catastrophe. Many are plagued by a troubling sense that this time is different.

“This is much more complicated,” says Carol Kellermann, who ran the charitable fund created after the September 11 terror attack and also led the Citizens Budget Commission advisory group. “I think it’s going to have much deeper, longer-lasting impacts.”

September 11 was brutal and devastating but the world rallied around the city and its economy resumed within days. After 2008, New York City ended up benefiting from policies that pumped vast sums of liquidity into the financial system.

With coronavirus, there is no quick fix in sight. The city’s morgues are overflowing after more than 21,000 fatalities — roughly eight times the city’s toll from the 9/11 attacks — and some are forecasting unemployment will rise to 20 per cent in June. Yet the city is arousing less sympathy from the nation than partisan resentment. New York feels alone.

Worst of all, the very thing that distinguishes New York City and accounts for its unique alchemy — its density — is what makes it so vulnerable to the pandemic. “Other than better treatments and a vaccine, I don’t know that there’s any government policy that can make people feel safer,” Ms Kellermann says.

Those with the means have left, quarantining in places such as the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Aspen. How many will have gone for good, she wonders, if the city’s cultural life is effectively closed and therefore unable to offset its high taxes and other indignities.

“There’s definitely going to be urban flight,” says Winston Fisher, a third-generation developer, who voiced an ever-present fear among New Yorkers of a certain vintage about a reversion to the bad old days. “I grew up in the city. I’ve been robbed at gunpoint. I remember what 59th and 6th used to look like, Times Square,” he recalls. “New York City can be bad. Don’t forget that.”

To prevent that, there is an emerging consensus that authorities must create a sense of safety, just as they managed to do after September 11. Otherwise, it will be impossible to restore business — let alone bring back tourists. It is a public health challenge but also a psychological one.

In the absence of a vaccine, the governor of New York state, Andrew Cuomo, has turned to former mayor Michael Bloomberg to spearhead a testing and tracing system. The hope is that as the city begins to reopen, the testers will be able to quickly find new infections and seal them off before they become outbreaks. As Mr Cuomo readily acknowledges, it is a huge undertaking.

Meanwhile, developers are rushing to refit office buildings that had been designed to accommodate a taste for ever-increasing density. Elevators are being reprogrammed to respond to smartphone apps so there is no need for passengers to touch a button. Internal doors are being removed for the same purpose.

A critical focus in this decontamination is the world’s biggest — and possibly most blighted — underground system. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has begun a regime that would have been unimaginable just a few months ago: to scrub and disinfect each subway car and station every single day.

“New York City and the MTA are fundamentally built on density. That density creates intellectual collaboration and culture and business and Wall Street and finance and design,” says Pat Foye, the MTA chairman, explaining the subway’s essential role as the circulatory system for a global metropolis.

Mr Foye predicts that new cleaning technologies “could be real game-changers in terms of public confidence in the system”. But cleanliness will come at a cost: he estimates “hundreds of millions of dollars” in additional expense at a time when ridership and fare revenue are down by more than 90 per cent.

The MTA has received $3.9bn in emergency funding from the federal government and is already pleading for another $3.9bn infusion just to make it through this year.

That is but one example of the fiscal challenges now lurking at every turn. Mr de Blasio, whose administration has added 30,000 workers to the city’s payroll since he took office in 2014, has estimated the budget shortfall caused by the virus shutdown at $7.4bn. Others have put it closer to $10bn.

Whatever the figure, Seth Pinsky, who led economic development during the Bloomberg administration, worries that it may pose the most direct threat to a virtuous circle in which talent and companies have chased each other to the city.

“The key to New York’s success over the last 20-plus years has been the first-class workforce it has been able to attract,” says Mr Pinsky, who recently took over as head of 92nd Street Y, one of the city’s leading cultural institutions. “What I worry about is that as government starts to react to the fiscal situation we are going to be forced to make cuts to basic services that are going to be so devastating that they will undermine the quality of life in the city.”

Finding ways to preserve restaurants, museums, galleries and the like is not just “having a soft spot for arts and culture”, Mr Pinsky says. Rather, it is essential to maintain the appeal — and viability — of an otherwise expensive and challenging place to live.

When Donald Trump was elected president, some New Yorkers consoled themselves that he was, at least, one of them, and could therefore be counted on to look out for the city’s interests. But his sustained hostility to the city that voted overwhelmingly against him in 2016 is dimming hopes for federal support.

Mr Trump’s 2017 tax cut was largely paid for by punishing New York and other, Democratic-leaning high-tax states. Even if Mr Trump were inclined to help, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has dismissed pleas for coronavirus aid as “blue-state bailouts”.

After September 11, Mr Bloomberg responded to the downturn by raising property taxes, a stream of revenue that accounts for nearly a third of New York City’s $89bn budget. But that trick will not be easily repeated.

Developers may be in no position to shoulder a heavier financial burden at a time when many of their own tenants have stopped paying rent. They are also confronting a larger fear: after a crash course in remote working, some of the city’s biggest employers — including BlackRock and Morgan Stanley — have announced that they will require less office space in the future. If that conclusion is widespread, then Manhattan property values may be headed for a reckoning.

Even before coronavirus, the wealthy were beginning to flee the city’s rising taxes for places such as Florida and Texas. “People are leaving New York and they’re leaving New York in droves,” says Norman Radow, a one-time New York developer who is now based in Atlanta. The coronavirus, he adds, “is just the icing on the cake”.

Still, Mr Radow’s own experience made him wonder if there might be investment opportunities ahead. He first moved to Manhattan in 1978, the depths of the fiscal crisis, and bought a two-bedroom apartment for $63,000. “Everyone thought it was the end of New York,” he recalls. “And look what happened.”

Amid the wreckage there are shards of hope. Some are warming to the possibility that a city that became so overheated in this cheap-money era — a bastion of billionaires, ensconced in Hudson Yards — might now undergo a pandemic-induced reset. Cheaper rents may eventually make the city more accessible for a new generation, who will put spaces to use in ways their elders can scarcely imagine.

“It always happens after every crisis. It seeds the next phase,” says Daniel Kaplan, senior partner at architecture firm FXCollaborative. WeWork, Mr Kaplan notes, was born from the unused office space left in the wake of the 2008 crisis.

Ms Kellermann agrees: “My daughter, who’s 35, says it’s going to go back to what it was in the ‘70s and ‘80s — grittier, but more risk-takers.” (She acknowledges that her daughter had not actually experienced New York in the 1970s — a time when the annual murder rate breached 2,000 and the subway was off-limits after nightfall.)

Mr Fisher now sees a rare chance to streamline an antiquated city government and improve the flow of credit to small businesses. Like other members of the business community, he would also like the city to prioritise the life sciences industry as a next source of high-paying jobs — just as the Bloomberg administration cultivated the tech sector.

Even with Amazon’s decision last year to cancel plans for a second headquarters in Queens, New York City has still managed to attract billions of dollars in investment from the online retailer, as well as Facebook and Google, that have shined and reshaped the city’s west side, including Hudson Yards.

Mr Weisbrod wants to build more affordable housing. “I think the pendulum has swung way too far against development,” he says. “Everybody says they want more affordable housing but nobody wants it in their neighbourhood.”

With coronavirus prying open the public’s eyes to the disparities between rich and poor, there may be the chance. At the same time, Mr Weisbrod and other civic leaders worry how the crisis will eventually shape the city’s politics. Will it be a constructive force that brings reform — or a divisive one that ultimately pits communities against one another?

The race next year to succeed Mr de Blasio as mayor may be one of the most consequential campaigns in the city’s modern history. Will his successor be another self-described “progressive” or a member of the executive class, in the mould of Mr Bloomberg — or something else entirely? Whoever prevails should have faith in New York’s resilience but also, as Mr Pinsky warns, not forget its darker days.

“Those were ugly times,” he says of the 1970s, when New York City’s economic base was wrecked and its population shrank by 800,000 residents. “It took us decades to crawl out of that hole. We should be very careful about not falling back in.”

M0826e,21/04/2005,mainstream,"In two earlier columns on Europe’s database directive, and European public information, I pointed out that our policy-process is almost evidence-free. New rights are created on the basis of anecdote and scaremongering. There are other examples and they are not confined to Europe.

Thomas Macaulay told us copyright law is a tax on readers for the benefit of writers, a tax that shouldn’t last a day longer than necessary. What do we do? We extend the copyright term repeatedly on both sides of the Atlantic. The US goes from fourteen years to the author’s life plus seventy years. We extend protection retrospectively to dead authors, perhaps in the hope they will write from their tombs.

Since only about 4 per cent of copyrighted works more than 20 years old are commercially available, this locks up 96 per cent of 20th century culture to benefit 4 per cent. The harm to the public is huge, the benefit to authors, tiny. In any other field, the officials responsible would be fired. Not here.

It is as if we had signed an international stupidity pact, one that required us to ignore the evidence, to hand out new rights without asking for the simplest assessment of need. If the stakes were trivial, no one would care. But intellectual property (IP) is important. These are the ground rules of the information society. Mistakes hurt us. They have costs to free speech, competition, innovation, and science. Why are we making them?

To some the answer is obvious: corporate capture of the decision making process. This is a nicely cynical conclusion. But wait. There are economic interests on both sides. The film and music industries are tiny compared the consumer electronics industry. Yet copyright law dances to the tune played by the former, not the latter. Open source software is big business. But the international IP bureaucracies seem to view it as godless communism.

If money talks, why can decision-makers only hear one side of the conversation? Corporate capture can only be part of the explanation. Something more is needed. We need to deconstruct the culture of IP stupidity, to understand it so we can change it. But this is a rich and complex stupidity, like a fine Margaux. I can only review a few flavours.

Maximalism: The first thing to realize is that many decisions are driven by honest delusion, not corporate corruption. The delusion is maximalism: the more intellectual property rights we create, the more innovation. This is clearly wrong; rights raise the cost of innovation inputs (lines of code, gene sequences, data.) Do their monopolistic and anti-competitive effects outweigh their incentive effects? That’s the central question, but many of our decision makers seem never to have thought of it.

The point was made by an exchange inside the Committee that shaped Europe’s ill-starred Database Directive. It was observed that the US, with no significant property rights over unoriginal compilations of data, had a much larger database industry than Europe which already had significant “sweat of the brow” protection in some countries. Europe has strong rights, the US weak. The US is winning.

Did this lead the committee to wonder for a moment whether Europe should weaken its rights? No. Their response was that this showed we had to make the European rights much stronger. The closed-mindedness is remarkable. “That man eats only a little salad and looks slim. Clearly to look as good as him, we have to eat twice as much, and doughnuts too!”

Authorial Romance: Part of the delusion depends on the idea that inventors and artists create from nothing. Who needs a public domain of accessible material if one can create out of thin air? But in most cases this simply isn’t true; artists, scientists and technologists build on the past. How would the blues, jazz, Elizabethan theatre, or Silicon valley have developed if they had been forced to play under today’s rules? Don’t believe me? Ask a documentary filmmaker about clearances, or a free-software developer about software patents.

An Industry Contract: Who are the subjects of IP? They used to be companies. You needed a printing press or a factory to trigger the landmines of IP. The law was set up as a contract between industry groups. This was a cosy arrangement, but it is no longer viable. The citizen-publishers of cyberspace, the makers of free software, the scientists of distributed data-analysis are all now implicated in the IP world. The decision-making structure has yet to adjust.

There are many more themes. The idea that greater control, for example, is always better (see my column on public data) or the way we only ever internationally harmonize rights upward. Fundamentally, though, the views I have criticised here are not merely stupidity. They constitute an ideology, a worldview, like flat earth-ism. But the world is not flat and the stupidity pact is not what we want to sign.

Let me be clear. IP is a good thing. (There are also important strands I have not discussed, such as natural rights and the droits d’auteur. They will get their own column.) Not all proposals to extend rights are silly, but if we do not start looking rigorously at evidence, we will never know which.

At my university, we set up The Center for the Study of the Public Domain to study the contributions of the public domain to creativity. We found we were the only such academic centre in the world. At first that made us feel innovative. Later it made us worried. If we don’t look at the evidence and we ignore the role of the public domain in fostering innovation, how can we possibly hope to make good policy?

M0d586,01/04/2020,mainstream,"Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story

The imperative to “test, test, test” has become a slogan of the coronavirus pandemic since it was voiced last month by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization. But the simple goal continues to elude even well-off countries that are struggling to track the spread of the virus among their populations.

Germany and South Korea have led the way in rolling out tests on a large scale, but the UK and US have been laggards. The greater the delays, the more prolonged the uncertainty over the size of the virus threat. As hunger for diagnosis grows, as testing kits are rejected and impatience with government mounts, we look at the available technologies, their potential and limitations.

What tests are available for coronavirus infection?

There are two main types. The first, an antigen test, detects the presence or absence in the body of the new coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19. The second, an antibody test, looks for signs that someone has been infected in the past by searching for an immune response.

Since Chinese scientists in mid-January published the full genetic code of the virus — officially known as Sars-CoV-2 — laboratories anywhere in the world have been able to use antigen testing to identify its genes in samples from patients. They use a procedure called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that has been standard practice in labs for 30 years.

PCR samples can come from several different sites in the patient. Simplest is the nasal swab taken from well inside the nose. The back of the throat is another option. For patients in hospital, a sample from the lower respiratory tract may give the best results. Antigen testing reveals whether someone has a current infection and could therefore pass Covid-19 on to others.

In contrast, antibody (or serological) tests work on blood samples to detect the immunity conferred by past infection. The test kits use proteins from the virus as “glue” to trap antibodies present in blood, said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology at the University of Edinburgh.

A finger prick should provide enough blood to detect two types of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2. The first, IgM antibodies, are shortlived and may indicate that the virus is still present. They usually disappear a couple of weeks after infection. In their place emerge a second more durable type, IgG antibodies. No one knows yet how long these will last and provide resistance to reinfection — anything from a few months to a few years seems possible.

Antibody tests are being prioritised by governments including the UK and Germany because they will be essential to informing individuals whether they can return to mixing safely in society without passing on or picking up infection. When carried out in a representative sample of the population, they will also answer key epidemiological questions — including about how many people were infected with mild or no symptoms.

Once developed, antibody tests should give results more quickly than traditional PCR tests, taking a few minutes rather than a few hours, though much faster antigen kits are under development.

When health authorities began to realise that the coronavirus outbreak might pose a global threat, they started developing tests in government labs such as those operated by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Public Health England, which already had ample experience in using PCR technology for diagnostics.

Traditionally, antigen diagnosis is done mostly in the public sector, with private companies providing test components such as chemical reagents and swabs for patient samples — some of which have been in short supply. But in recent weeks there has been a huge mobilisation of private sector resources as businesses around the world race to enter a rapidly expanding market, rolling out automated PCR kits that process samples much more quickly than conventional labs.

New antigen tests are relatively easy to create because “the PCR test is a small addition to an existing test”, said James Gill, clinical lecturer at Warwick Medical School.

But antibody tests take longer to develop because they have to be created from scratch. “You’ve had to physically get patient blood, find the antibodies in that blood (molecules smaller than the virus), create a reproducible antibody in the lab, and then create a reagent test that will react in the presence of that antibody — which can be read by health teams,” said Dr Gill.

The private sector has played an outsized role in the development and manufacturing of antibody tests, though its products still have to be validated by public health authorities before use.

The presence of Chinese companies has stood out in the effort to boost the supply of both types of test. Of 202 companies around the world producing commercialised Covid-19 test kits, 92 are from China, where the outbreak originated and an innovative medical technology sector is thriving.

According to data from the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (Find), a Geneva-based non-profit group that tracks product development, the second-largest number of coronavirus testing companies is in the US, which has 29.

Find’s list is not exhaustive and does not include some major players that have not sought to appear. Among them are Nasdaq-listed Hologic, whose test the US Food and Drug Administration has authorised for emergency use.

Beyond conventional antibody and antigen tests, researchers in universities and biotech companies are developing imaginative new diagnostic technologies. For instance Crispr, a gene editing technique that has taken the biotech world by storm, can be adapted to recognise and cut specific genetic sequences in Sars-CoV-2, which can then be identified via colour changes.

How fast are tests being rolled out?

Very unevenly — and not fast enough in many countries. Although there is no official centralised database, Find has collated data that indicates a cumulative total of more than 4.9m tests had been carried out worldwide by March 29. But that figure excludes China because the group could only obtain reliable data for one Chinese province.

South Korea, the country that got going first with extensive Covid-19 testing, has so far carried out 394,000 (equivalent to 770 per 100,000 people). Iceland has done 4,160 tests per 100,000.

The US was very slow to get started, because the CDC’s first test did not work well, so it had to go back to the drawing board to create a new one. It was then slow to allow other labs to test for Covid-19. But over the past two weeks US has ramped up testing rapidly.

Among larger European countries, the champion seems to be Germany, where public health officials have estimated that laboratories are carrying out as many as 500,000 coronavirus tests a week. Though official data has yet to confirm that number, it suggests that testing capacity has expanded fast in recent weeks. Germany’s decentralised test and laboratory infrastructure means the work is carried out not just in hospitals and doctors' practices but also in special drive-in stations.

Manufacturers are ready to supply the world with many millions of antibody tests, but health authorities and regulators are still evaluating their accuracy before allowing them to be rolled out widely. Last week Matt Hancock, UK health secretary, announced that the country had ordered 3.5m antibody test kits from various manufacturers.

How reliable are the tests?

The PCR test is extremely accurate when carried out carefully by experienced technicians in a well-equipped lab. Because it specifically detects genes found only in the Sars-CoV-2 virus, it will produce very few false positives, said Andrew Preston, reader in microbial pathogenesis at the University of Bath.

False negatives — which indicate wrongly that someone is clear of infection — are more of a problem. They often result from problems with collecting and processing patient samples. For other viruses, false negative rates of 10 per cent are widely accepted and they can reach as high as 30 per cent. Therefore PCR tests “have more often been used to confirm an infection rather than give someone the all clear”, said Dr Gill at Warwick Medical School.

The accuracy and reliability of the new antibody tests will not be known until they have been validated and technicians have gained more operating experience.

Spain’s ministry of health last week withdrew 8,000 Chinese-made testing kits delivered to Madrid’s regional government because of worries about inaccurate results. But the manufacturer Shenzhen Bioeasy said the problems may have been because of incorrect sample collection or use of the product.

Dr Preston said: “It is not easy to quickly and massively ramp up testing capacity when it requires both high-quality kits and properly trained staff.”"

In 2006, Ms Hollender co-authored a book called Naturally Clean: The Seventh Generation Guide to Safe and Healthy Non-Toxic Cleaning. In 2013, she completed her MBA course, specialising in social impact and sustainability.

1. What is your biggest lesson learnt?

Business school was the first time I really went outside my comfort zone. I applied to be the president of the social enterprise association and decided to start Sustain. I learnt that pushing yourself beyond what’s comfortable is critical to evolving personally and professionally.

Stern helped because it pushed me to explore what I really wanted to do. While there, I worked in sustainability at Johnson & Johnson, where I was surrounded by all these incredible entrepreneurs who encouraged me to create change on my own. It just so happened that at the time my father Jeffrey Hollender began writing the business plan for Sustain. He came to me for advice and I became more and more interested in it.

2. How have you developed your idea for Sustain?

When we started Sustain, we learnt there were 20m women in the US who lacked access to reproductive healthcare and family planning services. We also discovered that 1 in 4 female college freshmen contract an STD in their first year. Overall, there are 19 million STIs contracted in the US every year and 50 per cent of pregnancies are unplanned.

We knew that Sustain alone couldn’t move the needle quickly enough to address these critical issues, and therefore we created a separate part of the company called 10%4Women. This initiative donates 10 per cent of our pre-tax profits to places like Planned Parenthood, an organisation that has been addressing these issues for decades.

3. Why did you choose to attend NYU Stern?

When I was deciding which business school to attend, I went to an NYU event, where I heard the dean Peter Henry speak. He talked about transforming the school to prepare students to think about how to use business to address the social and economic issues our world faces, and this resonated with me. Although Stern was not known for being the most progressive and socially innovative school, I wanted to be part of it’s evolution.

4. What is your favourite memory of business school?

Running the school’s social enterprise association. I had never been in charge of an organisation before and as co-president I learnt what it was like. This included how to prepare for and run a board meeting, and how to ensure the school continued to fund us each semester.

5. What did you find the most difficult?

Figuring out what I wanted to do next. When you enter business school you’re presented with two ‘tracks’: one track is going through the processes of preparing for jobs in ‘traditional’ industries like finance, brand management, consulting, and the second track is to do something like fashion, entrepreneurship, media, etc. The first track is attractive because there is a structure in place. If you follow the steps, you will get a lucrative job. Unfortunately, many business schools have failed to make the second track more alluring and so students (like myself) struggle to figure out what they really want to do versus what they feel like they should do.

6. What were the gender dynamics like?

My class was 40 per cent female, so I really didn’t feel like I was in a ‘boys club.’ Also, a handful of my professors were women.

7. How do you deal with male dominated environments?

By not letting my mindset change. Recently, I spent 10 days alone at our factory in southern India. I was the only woman on site except for the women preparing lunch in the kitchen. I could have gone into that situation acting timid, or expecting that our business partners wouldn’t listen to what I had to say, but I decided before getting on the plane that I would not have that mindset.

8. Who is your ideal professor?

Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood. On top of being a female business leader in a male-dominated world, she also runs an organisation that addresses issues that people in the country don’t want to talk about. Even among backlash and criticism, she is incredibly strong and brave, not letting anyone impede her mission. She really is a huge inspiration.

9. What is your favourite business book?

The Responsibility Revolution: How the Next Generation of Businesses Will Win by Bill Breen and my father: “When we bring a higher level of consciousness to our work, good things tend to follow.”

10. What are your top tips for networking?

Before I got to business school, I was not great at networking. What I quickly learnt is that women like helping other women. I think it comes from typically being the underdogs in the business world.

Slowly, we are proving that we are just as, if not more, capable than our male peers, and a lot of this is happening because women are banding together. So be bold, ask the right questions, do you homework, and I think you’ll find that people are usually willing to help."
M12fbb,16/06/2020,mainstream,"Only a fool breaks the two-metre rule. This has been the mantra in the UK, where painted pavements and supermarket signage urge people to stay two metres apart to prevent coronavirus infection.

The rule is now under review in the UK, to the relief of ministers and business people who foresee a bleak future for a hospitality and entertainment industry that is currently without a critical mass of customers. They favour the World Health Organization’s one-metre recommendation, which has already been adopted by China, Hong Kong and Denmark. A decision is due in early July, when more sectors of the British economy are scheduled to reopen.

The fixation on distance usefully highlights a persistent theme in the public discussion of risk: a false, binary distinction between safety and danger. No magic attaches to either distance: some countries, including Australia, Belgium and Germany, have opted for one and a half metres.

The choice is not whether to be safe at two metres or unsafe at one — but whether we want to take more risk or less, and to what end. Reopening the economy before the virus is conquered means governments taking tough decisions on how society should function in a landscape of uncertain risk.

Uncertainty should not, however, mean junking the precautionary principle, given that Covid-19 is still springing unwelcome health surprises. For example, since we know some people can carry the virus without showing symptoms, we must assume they can also transmit it until proven otherwise.

This is the most convincing argument for donning face coverings or masks, especially indoors and on public transport, where distancing can be difficult. It is, mostly, an act of consideration towards others: face coverings prevent the projection of virus-laden droplets towards people and surfaces, where others can pick them up (the WHO recommends fabric coverings made of three layers of different materials, rather than medical masks).

Face coverings might also be important given the continuing disagreement over airborne transmission (via aerosol particles that are finer than the droplets emitted in coughs and sneezes and which can hang in the air for longer). A highly contested paper published last week suggested that such transmission was not only likely but dominant. Still, it is worth noting the pro-mask attitude in countries that have kept infection rates relatively low: there is no shame in copying measures for which there seems to be a rationale.

When it comes to social distancing, timing as well as distance is critical. Spending six seconds at one metre from an infected person carries roughly the same transmission risk as spending a minute at two metres, according to Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser to the UK government. The risk continues to fall with distance.

Outside is safer than inside because breezes disperse droplets and aerosols. Superspreading events have mostly been documented indoors — such as in nightclubs, gyms and churches (shouting, heavy breathing and singing all propel droplets further). Avoiding indoor meetings also cuts the chance that an infected visitor will leave traces of virus on surfaces for others to pick up.

These precautions, and others, matter because, in order to infect someone, the virus must physically enter the body via the mouth, nose or eyes. Every mandate or recommendation — including social distancing, face coverings, meeting outdoors, indoor ventilation, handwashing, cough etiquette — is designed to cut the chances of that happening. While public discussions tend to fixate on them singly, they are meant to be applied together — and in conjunction with a strong disease surveillance system to detect new outbreaks.

Still, the resurgence of the virus in Beijing, which had gone 50 days without a new case, is also a portent that we will be living amid uncertainty for many months to come. Until a vaccine arrives, deciding whether to shrink social distancing to expand the economy will be just one of many imperfect risk calculations on the table."
M1a562,08/03/2019,mainstream,"Too many organisations in global health are failing to address imbalances in pay and leadership and doing too little to tackle sexual harassment of women, who make up 70 per cent of the workforce.

That is the conclusion of Global Health 50/50's annual audit of gender inequality. The greatest discrepancies are at the top: seven out of ten executive heads and board chairs are men. They also earn 13.5 per cent more.

“The global health sector stands for fairness and universality, and strives to ensure health for everyone, particularly the most marginalised . . . If there is one sector that should set precedent in this space, it is global health,” says Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand prime minister, introducing the report.

Other reports marking International Women's Day catalogued problems facing women outside the workplace, from the “forgotten emergency” of unsafe abortion — one of the main causes of maternal mortality — to stigmas around menstruation. “Menstruating girls can even be banished to outside sheds where they suffer in cold and isolation, often at risk of illness and animal attacks,” UN experts said.

Despite some positive contributions — such as the UK's commitment to end global “period poverty” by 2030 — there is still a long way to go before women across the world have the rights to control their own bodies, including sexual and reproductive rights, without interference.

M18851,08/02/2020,mainstream,"Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story

The human cost of coronavirus has continued to mount, with more than 10.6m cases confirmed globally and more than 507,500 people known to have died.

The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a pandemic and it has spread to more than 200 countries around the world.

This page provides an up-to-date visual narrative of the spread of Covid-19, so please check back regularly because we will be refreshing it with new graphics and features as the story evolves.

Europe’s average count of coronavirus-related deaths overtook Asia in early March, with Italy, Spain and the UK becoming the new global hotspots. From mid-April the focus shifted to the US where the number of deaths remained consistently high, and currently accounts for 12 per cent of global deaths. Latin America has recently seen its share increase to more than half of new deaths, fueled by a surge in Covid-19 fatalities in Brazil.

There are concerns, however, that reported Covid-19 deaths are not capturing the true impact of coronavirus on mortality around the world. The FT has gathered and analysed data on excess mortality — the numbers of deaths over and above the historical average — across the globe, and has found that death tolls in some countries are more than 50 per cent higher than usual. In many countries, these excess deaths exceed reported numbers of Covid-19 deaths by large margins.

The picture is even starker in the hardest-hit cities and regions. In Ecuador’s Guayas province, there have been 10,000 more deaths than normal since the start of March, an increase of more than 300 per cent. London has seen overall deaths more than double, and New York City’s total death numbers since mid March are more than four times the norm.

The FT is mapping the virus as it spreads. Check back for our up-to-date figures.

The death toll has now passed 100 in 31 European countries. The region currently only accounts for 10 per cent of new daily cases, well down from the peak of over 80 per cent in March.

Coronavirus has spread to all 50 states in the US. More than 2.67m cases and 120,600 deaths have been confirmed in the country.

M0c759,12/09/2019,mainstream,"Life in a distant future as imagined by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will be, in many ways, like life today. People will socialise, commute to work and have weekends to rest.

The only difference is that we will be living in huge spinning cylinders that closely mimic our planet, but are actually in orbit around it.

The world’s richest man, according to Forbes, is one of several prominent people who are thinking seriously about what humans might do if they ever have to develop habitats beyond Earth.

Mr Bezos’s vision is based on ideas first put forward in the 1970s by the Princeton scientist Gerard O’Neill. He proposed that humans could live in a set of twin cylinders, each measuring four miles in diameter and 16 miles in length. The cylinders counter-rotate so they keep facing the sun.

At a recent event for his space company Blue Origin, Mr Bezos suggested that a series of these colonies could be designed for specific uses: some residential, others for industry and leisure. He even proposed that some cylinders could have a lower gravitational pull so residents could “go flying with your own wings”.

The weather, he said, will be “like Maui on its best day, all year round”, referring to the picturesque Hawaiian island.

“Imagine what architecture would be like if it did not have to fulfil its primary purpose of shelter,” he told the event in Washington, DC, in May this year.

Mr Bezos is not the only person exploring the idea of living in space. As the effects of climate change become more apparent, governments, scientists and entrepreneurs across the world have started looking more seriously at concepts that were once considered more within the realm of science fiction.

“People have always shown they will do what is necessary to survive,” says Therese Griebel, deputy associate administrator for programmes at Nasa’s Space Technology Mission Directorate. “If the Earth becomes unsustainable, there will be a reason to go somewhere else.”

Other plans to live in space take various forms. Ms Griebel predicts humans could live sustainably on the moon by 2028, if Nasa can find a way for us to survive the freezing lunar night. SpaceX founder Elon Musk, meanwhile, prefers the longer-haul option of Mars.

The main challenge for any proposal is to find a way to extract resources from wherever humans choose to live. On the moon, this is likely to mean using the ice found recently at its poles and converting it into water, oxygen and hydrogen for fuel.

ISpace is just one of a handful of companies which thinks that such an opportunity could be turned into profit. The Japanese company says it has raised nearly $100m in its quest to get to the moon and start mining it. Its founder and chief executive, Takeshi Hakamada, says this will be the first step towards setting up a permanent colony there.

“The biggest hurdle to living in space is finding the resources needed to fuel your transportation needs,” says Mr Hakamada. “You need a lot of propellant, so mining the moon is the best way to get that.”

The company plans to land on the moon in 2021: Mr Hakamada predicts there will be a community of at least 1,000 people living and working there by 2040.

Mining the moon is also a crucial part of Mr Bezos’s plan. He has promised to sell $1bn worth of his stock in Amazon every year to help fund Blue Origin, which is planning to land on the moon by 2024.

Even among space enthusiasts, however, there is some scepticism that moon mining could ever work.

Al Globus, a former contractor at Nasa, is a proponent of O’Neill colonies, but believes the materials will have to come from Earth rather than another planetary body. “Mines fail on earth all the time,” he says. “I don’t think we are going to get it right on the moon, especially not first time.”

Some think that neither the moon nor purpose-built colonies will ever be big enough to house humanity should Earth’s resources run out. Mr Musk could counter this with his plan to fly humans to Mars in the next five years as the first step in the planet’s slow colonisation.

He says he can overcome Mars’ cold conditions by setting off nuclear explosions in its atmosphere — a plan he has referred to as “nuke Mars”.

Critics say these schemes are the idle fantasies of middle-aged men, which threaten to distract from attempts to solve climate change on Earth. Emily Cunningham, an Amazon employee, told Mr Bezos at the company’s annual shareholder meeting this year: “Our home planet Earth, not far-off places in space, desperately needs bold leadership.”

ISpace predicts it is likely to cost up to $10bn just to start producing fuel from the ice on the moon, making heavy government investment a necessity — something that seems unlikely given the more immediate domestic problems most developed countries are trying to solve.

Some involved in space research, however, predict that as early experimental missions start to yield results, public and governmental interest in interplanetary living will grow, giving it the impetus it needs.

Ms Griebel says: “Once you start building the infrastructure to extract resources from the moon, you will be able to sustain people for longer and longer. It becomes more real as you start to do it.”"
M112c9,01/08/2019,mainstream,"Seven grave diggers dressed in medical smocks, surgical gloves and plastic boots lifted the coffin from the back of a truck and began to pick their way through more than 200 fresh burial mounds, whose simple wooden crosses cast long shadows.

Masika Kahongya was 19 and newly married when she died last month after contracting the Ebola virus. She now lies in a crowded forest clearing outside the town of Beni, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a few metres from the grave of her three-month-old son, Innocent.

The mother and child are among 1,803 people killed in the Ebola outbreak since the first cases were confirmed near Beni exactly a year ago. Surpassed only by the epidemic that claimed more than 11,000 lives in west Africa from 2014-16, it is the longest and deadliest in Congo’s history.

Each of the country’s previous nine outbreaks since 1976, when the virus was first identified, occurred in remote regions and were controlled within three months. This time, thousands of health professionals have been deployed and more than 170,000 people have received an effective trial vaccine. Yet May, the tenth month, was the deadliest so far, and a further 349 cases were confirmed in July.

The accepted explanation for the failure of the international response has been to blame the low-level conflict that has destabilised eastern Congo for two decades. The presence of armed groups in North Kivu province made it difficult to reach victims and administer vaccinations, the country’s health ministry and the World Health Organization have said.

Some members of the response effort have been attacked and medical centres burnt down. But dozens of interviews with health professionals, aid workers, victims and their families paint a more complex picture of a response that has succeeded in some areas and failed in others.

On the red-dirt roads across the region, tens of thousands of people are stopped each day to have their hands disinfected and temperatures taken. In the new Ebola treatment centres, doctors deliver expert care.

The problem, according to the health ministry, is that up to 40 per cent of Ebola victims ignore official advice to visit such centres, and instead die at home and infect others.

“Community deaths are the worst scenario, and make it very difficult to control the epidemic,” said Gaston Tshapenda, the ministry’s senior official in Beni. “We need to break this vicious circle and establish trust with the community.”

Clovis Mutsuva, a local youth group leader, said the population had good reason to be suspicious. Last year, the government in Kinshasa, the capital, used the outbreak as an excuse to cancel a presidential election in opposition-voting Beni and nearby Butembo, despite recommendations from the health ministry and others that it would be safe to proceed.

“That’s the source of the resistance right there,” Mr Mutsuva said. Health workers with the government and WHO have treated communities poorly, he added, issuing ultimatums rather than advice.

There is also a perception some people have profited from the response. Hundreds of expensive off-road vehicles ply the region’s bumpy roads and “Ebola-business” has become a refrain among locals puzzled by the big inflow of money into their region.

“Where were they when our people were hacked to death by armed groups, or when thousands perished from malaria?” Mr Mutsuva asked.

That failure to build trust means doubts linger, even in well-educated families. “The response brings us nothing . . . just corpses and more corpses,” said Hussein Wabuzi, a former parliamentary candidate, whose sister-in-law died from the virus last month.

At his son’s bedside in the Beni treatment centre, Fauzi Muhindo was hopeful. He could see and talk to eight-year-old Kambale but they were prevented from touching. Like other patients, the boy was enclosed in a clear plastic treatment cube.

The technology was developed after the west African outbreak and allows medics to care for patients without risk of infection. “The rumours on the outside and the reality [inside the centre] is very different,” said Mr Muhindo. “The situation is so much better than I was told.”

Inside another cube, nurse Leoni Nduelo held the hand of a patient who gasped for breath. Unlike other health professionals, Ms Nduelo did not wear full protective clothing. She survived Ebola last year and is one of a small number of health workers immune to the virus.

While such commitment is common, a breakthrough against the virus remains elusive. Anne Marie Pegg, a Médecins Sans Frontières doctor who co-ordinates the aid group’s efforts in eastern Congo, said the issue was not the implementation of the response, but with the strategy itself.

Following the experience in west Africa from 2014-16 when the health services of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia collapsed under the outbreak, the response in Congo has focused on creating a parallel health system where suspected cases are diverted into specialist facilities.

In hindsight, given that the Congolese epidemic has so far totalled far fewer cases — 2,593 in Congo versus 28,616 in west Africa — it was the wrong approach, she said. Instead, money should have been invested in building up existing health centres to test patients before sending confirmed cases on for treatment, Ms Pegg said.

“You can have the best Ebola treatment centre on the planet, but if people never get to it, it cannot help.”

Recent developments suggest a change may be under way.

In response to pressure from aid agencies and the threat that the virus could extend into new areas, the WHO last month declared the outbreak an international emergency, the highest level of global health crisis and only the fifth time the designation has been used.

Three days later, Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi set up a committee headed by Jean-Jacques Muyembe, a respected virologist, to lead the response. Mr Muyembe, 77, was one of two people who were dispatched to the Ebola river in 1976 to investigate the first known cases of the disease. He has previously been critical of the response and is expected to consider new approaches.

That could include the roll-out of a second trial Ebola vaccine being developed by US pharmaceutical group Johnson & Johnson. Its use was blocked last month by the then health minister who said it would undermine community trust in the Merck vaccine currently being delivered. The minister quit days after the Muyembe committee was established, decrying “interference”.

For experts such as Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, this new approach could help turn the tide by allowing a vaccination programme in areas where the virus has not yet been detected.

This would create a “curtain” of immunised people around the epidemic, providing a window to bring it under control, he explained. “It is clear that the current strategy has not worked,” he said. “There is an immediate need for a reset.”"
M15692,19/12/2014,mainstream,"Elvis has entered the building. The big, round one on London’s North Greenwich peninsula, which started life as a pointless celebration of the new millennium but is now paying its way by celebrating the popular culture protagonists of the old millennium. Elvis at the O2 plunders more than 300 artefacts from the Presley family’s Graceland archives: Elvis’s school reports, his record collection, his pink Cadillac, his weirdly spangled jumpsuits. It is a curious mixture of the banal and the resplendent, and none the worse for that. The recipes for genius are concocted from strange fruit, and it is right to celebrate them in all their diversity.

I found myself riveted — who wouldn’t? — in the room dedicated to the 1968 Comeback Special, commemorating the television show that proved to a sceptical public that the 33-year-old still had the musical chops to make a further contribution to his art form. A helpful assistant asked if I had any questions. I was experiencing an emotional moment next to the black leather suit, so I decided to play it flip. “Yes, how did he get his teeth so white?” My interlocutor didn’t miss a beat. “Because he was from another planet.”

I knew what he meant, and he knew that I knew, and I found myself wishing that more museum staff could slip so effortlessly into lightly ironic magical realism. He told me that there had been a worry that the show contained too many images of Elvis but their concerns were dispelled when a member of the management team said simply: “Hey, it’s Elvis!” On they went, plastering the place with more and more portraits, filmed interviews, rollicking performances. Of course you can’t take your eyes off them. Put aside, for one moment, the voice and the gyrations. Was there ever another being of such physical beauty?

But the show is not all transcendent sexual allure. Not quite. Here are some of the quirky details I noted on a quick trip around Elvis at the O2:

● Elvis’s report from East Tupelo School for the 1943-44 academic year had an advertisement on its front page. (Sometimes you get a sharp reminder of why America is the country that it is.) It was for Glasgow’s Drug Store. “We make our own ice cream”, it says cunningly, before adding a more reassuring note for the over-nines: “Special care given to doctors’ prescriptions.”

● A letter from Elvis’s record label, RCA, to his infamous manager, Colonel Tom Parker, giving a detailed breakdown of sales of his first few singles. By far the highest sales — 1.4m — are recorded by “Heartbreak Hotel”. The letter, which contains nothing more interesting than that, is marked “confidential”. You would think that nothing would be more worthy of widespread and immediate dissemination than Elvis’s sales figures. Was it a guilty secret? Did they not believe what they read?

● The “gilded” telephone that was next to Elvis’s bed in Graceland has not weathered well. Its handset has lost its golden hue almost entirely. Talk is cheap; so was his telephone. Why?

● Elvis loved the Beatles. Here is his own personal copy of “Hey Jude”, which he went on to cover in concert. He has written something on the 45’s label: “LOOK”. Then there is an arrow pointing to the time of the song: “7:11”. A pop song really could last that long. Who was the arrow intended for? Was it an aide-mémoire? Must aim longer, higher, greater!

● Among the small pile of books from Elvis’s coffee table are Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet and the Warren report on the Kennedy assassination.

● A job reference says Elvis is a “rather flashily dressed, playboy-type”, but that this is “denied by fact [that he] has worked hard [the] past three summers”. Elvis, it adds, “wants a job dealing with people”. It was a solemn aspiration. No one ever failed to remark on Elvis’s good manners. The only person he treated with contempt was himself.

You can see anything you want at Elvis at the O2 apart, of course, from the full story. That is not what this exhibition is about. There are sensitivities to be borne in mind: a wife, a daughter. There is a controlling estate shaping the myth, determined to leave out its pathetic denouement. No one wants to leave this show on a downer.

And yet, if Elvis is to be treated as a serious cultural phenomenon, we need to see the whole narrative arc, the rise and the fall, as chronicled in Peter Guralnick’s heart-rending two-part biography. Elvis’s jumpsuits are legitimate museum artefacts but so are the piles of pills that finished him. If Elvis speaks with rare eloquence of his time, let him speak authentically and integrally.

But it may be too soon for all that. The only museum-quality show that has come close to capturing the complexities of popular music’s golden era is the Victoria and Albert Museum’s still-touring exhibition on David Bowie. But, then again, Bowie was always an artful commentator on his own celebrity. Elvis is a trickier proposition: a simpler artist, a simpler story, but harder to believe in. Almost, but not quite, otherworldly."
M1b515,25/06/2010,mainstream,"Death can be good for your credit score. A year ago Michael Jackson couldn’t pay his telephone, water or legal bills and had to find a way to repay a $300m Barclays loan at the end of 2010, or lose his half of the Beatles catalogue. Since then extra record sales (which rose almost 150-fold in the weeks after his death) along with a film about his last months and merchandise such as games and action figures, have generated about $250m.

How long the money keeps flowing depends on those managing the King of Pop’s estate. Plans to retain the Beatles catalogue and launch a Cirque du Soleil Las Vegas show suggest they will be aggressive. And why not? Elvis Presley’s estate still makes about $50m in revenue each year for its listed owners, 33 years after the King of Rock ’n’ Roll’s death. As it happens, it too has just launched a Cirque du Soleil Las Vegas Show. The King of the Afterlife crown is yet to be won.

M14617,20/11/2018,mainstream,"The EU’s Innovative Medicines Initiative has proved an important force for change over the first decade of its existence in streamlining the complex, expensive and risky process of medicines development.

IMI was created in 2008 as a partnership to increase the competitiveness of research and development in the European biopharma sector by encouraging companies to work with each other and with the public sector.

Its new strategy has a still broader mandate to bring groups involved in health together, extend its reach beyond Europe and prepare for digital disruption.

When the IMI began, many questioned whether companies would feel comfortable sharing their data and knowledge. More than 100 projects later, IMI has created an ecosystem that is catalytic in changing the way modern medicines development is carried out, and has paved the way for accelerated innovation.

Over the past decade, the EU and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations have committed €5bn through cash and in-kind support to researchers in companies working alongside academics. This has supported a series of large-scale, ambitious projects.

By funding national regulators, health technology assessment groups, patient organisations and advocates, IMI has given a stronger voice to the fuller range of stakeholders involved in medicines alongside traditional researchers, clinicians and industrialists.

More recently, IMI has attracted investments from new public and private partners, including the Wellcome Trust and the diabetes charity JDRF, as well as GE Healthcare and Illumina.

The results have been impressive. IMI-supported projects have generated almost 4,000 peer-reviewed research papers. Its partners have developed numerous new tools, methodologies and infrastructure to help researchers in industry and academia get better results, faster. Most significantly, there are projects that have influenced regulatory frameworks and helped patients directly.

One of these produced the first patient-reported outcome in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to be accepted by the European Medicines Agency. Another has created a Europe-wide clinical trial network specifically to test new anti­biotics for resistant infections.

In autism spectrum disorders, our projects have linked groundbreaking work on both sides of the Atlantic, enhancing collaboration and reducing duplication. In Alzheimer’s disease, one UK-led project is creating a clinical research platform that seeks ways to prevent its onset.

Medical research and drug development are evolving fast, and one challenge for IMI is to adapt to and anticipate new advances. The rise of “big data” is a case in point. The challenges cannot be overestimated: to integrate high-end research data from genomics, imaging and proteomics with clinical data; how to safely interrogate patients’ electronic health records for research purposes; and how to scale health informatics across Europe to harness knowledge for better patient intervention.

One of IMI’s biggest efforts has been to develop a co-ordinated approach under an initiative called Big Data for Better Outcomes. These projects, with more than €100m from public and private parties, develop ways to address technical and ethical questions on data management. It supports disease-specific projects that aim to put big data to work on conditions including Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, haematological malignancies and prostate cancer.

Another example in digital technology is WEB-RADR, led by the UK’s medicines regulatory agency. It developed an app that allows patients and healthcare providers to easily report side-effects of medicines to the relevant authorities. It is now available in the UK, Croatia and the Netherlands, as well as Burkina Faso and Zambia.

The future will build on all that has been achieved in IMI’s first decade. IMI will deepen and broaden its engagement with other sectors in health research, including digital, imaging, diagnostic, medtech and other emerging technologies.

IMI will also further strengthen links with global initiatives on antimicrobial resistance and autism. These challenges are too big to be limited to individual regions.

We need collectively to take advantage of the great science being funded in North America and Asia to avoid duplication, optimise synergies and accelerate progress.

A growing number of patients have said their lives have changed as a result of IMI projects. We need this pattern to be generalised across whole populations and translated into healthcare delivery, so society can benefit to maximum effect.

M0af5a,04/06/2019,mainstream,"Ten large pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and GSK, are embarking on the first collaboration to train their drug-discovery, machine-learning algorithms on each other’s data.

Owkin, a Google Ventures-backed start-up based in New York and Paris, has developed a secure, blockchain-based system that allows an algorithm to trawl competitors’ data with full traceability — but crucially, without revealing commercial secrets to rivals.

The machine-learning algorithm improves the models that predict how molecules will work, in the hope of accelerating the expensive and cumbersome drug discovery process. It costs an average of €1.9bn and 13 years to bring a drug to market, according to a 2016 paper in the Journal of Health Economics.

Mathieu Galtier, who co-ordinates the project for Owkin, said it aimed to significantly speed up the search process and understanding of which compounds might work as drugs.

“The big goal here is to accelerate and reduce the cost of the discovery of drugs,” he said.

Investors are flocking to start-ups trying to use artificial intelligence to improve the sometimes haphazard drug discovery process.

In the US, Schrödinger, a platform backed by Bill Gates and hedge fund manager David E Shaw, recently closed a $110m funding round; last year Boston-based Relay Therapeutics raised $400m from investors including the SoftBank Vision Fund; and Insitro has raised more than $100m from venture capitalists such as Andreessen Horowitz. In the UK, Genomics Plc, a spinout from the University of Oxford, signed a drug discovery deal with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the biotech company.

But while pharmaceutical companies have become customers of these start-ups, the Melloddy project — which stands for Machine Learning Ledger Orchestration for Drug Discovery — marks the first time they have shared data with each other. If successful, it could encourage the rivals to open up more data, including the results of pre-clinical studies.

Hugo Ceulemans, the Melloddy project leader, said the initiative had the potential to improve patient care.

“This project allows the pharma partners for the first time to collaborate in their core competitive space, invigorating discovery efforts through efficiency gains,” added Mr Ceulemans, who is also scientific director of discovery data sciences at Janssen Pharmaceutica, Johnson & Johnson’s Belgian-based drugmaker.

The Melloddy research consortium has €10m “in kind” funding from each company and €8m from the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private partnership. Some 17 partners including two European universities, four start-ups and Nvidia, the chipmaker, as well as the 10 pharmaceutical companies, form the consortium.

By using “federated learning”, a decentralised type of machine learning, pharma companies can keep the data from their chemical libraries inside their own infrastructure. Mr Galtier said Melloddy used blockchain because it meant pharma companies could trust the code, rather than their partners.

“We want absolute traceability of all operations made on the platform. It is very important that each pharma partner knows they are being treated on equal grounds, to make sure what is happening to their data is transparent so they can check it afterwards,” he said."
M16675,18/06/2020,mainstream,"Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story

The race to develop vaccines and treatments for Covid-19 has been described by many world leaders as the greatest challenge of our lifetimes.

But the coronavirus pandemic has reignited a longstanding debate about intellectual property protection and wider public access to medicines, as well as whether some protections should be temporarily overridden to deal with a global pandemic.

IP and patent law allows pharmaceutical companies to protect their investment and reap the benefits of fortunes spent in developing new products. It can take a decade or more for a drug to be developed and come to market so being able to enforce legal rights is crucial.

Many lawyers argue that the robust IP regime has always fostered innovation and that is why countries can collaborate. Pharmaceutical companies say they intend to co-operate with rivals in an unprecedented way to help find solutions. Companies like GlaxoSmithKline have already said they do not expect to profit from collaborations for Covid-19 vaccines during this pandemic.

“IP has enabled companies to help — there is no suggestion it has been a blocker during the crisis,” Nicole Jadeja, partner at Pinsent Masons, says. “There has been a lot of criticism in the past about IP and patents but those issues have always been there and the model we have at the moment incentivises research and development.

“The industry is acutely aware of its collaborative responsibility and you are getting collaboration.”

But some would like companies to go much further. Governments such as Chile, Israel and Ecuador have already signalled that the coronavirus pandemic justifies the use of compulsory licensing over patents related to coronavirus technologies. Such actions enable governments to license the use of a patented invention to a third party or government agency without the consent of the patent holder.

A group of IP lawyers and scientists have also launched the Open Covid Pledge urging companies to make IP that is relevant to Covid-19 free of charge until the pandemic is over. Companies that have signed up to the pledge include IBM, Amazon and Intel, according to its website.

The World Health Organization, supported by more than 30 countries including Norway, Brazil and Costa Rica, has launched a voluntary Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, or C-TAP, aimed at sharing research on coronavirus and making vaccines and tests universally available.

However, so far the initiative has failed to win the support of many western governments and pharmaceutical companies, which point to other existing initiatives with which they are involved.

At a recent briefing hosted by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, said: “If you don’t protect IP then essentially there is no incentive for anyone to innovate.” But he added: “What is important is that companies volunteer to provide their products at no profit, like we are doing, in case of pandemic or crisis when it’s needed.”

Ellen ‘t Hoen, director of research group Medicines Law & Policy, says the IP monopoly model has benefited drug companies in the past but is not the way forward for the solutions needed to combat coronavirus.

She adds that governments and aid bodies are spending billions of dollars on research and development but there are often no demands that this money should have strings attached. “The finance for the innovation here has been given upfront . . . There is no need to make a profit from Covid-19 as development here has been paid for by public money.”

Enrico Bonadio, a reader in intellectual property law at City University in London, agrees: “I am a big fan of IP, which is necessary, but this situation is unprecedented,” he says. “It is not normal times . . . And is not even a situation like HIV . . . this is an unprecedented circumstance which [could] allow one company to get a patent for a vaccine [that would] be unfair and unethical — but might not be illegal.”

He points to actions governments have taken to prompt the temporary relaxation of patents to help fight the pandemic — such as Israel which earlier this year issued a compulsory patent licence related to antiviral HIV medicine Kaletra, which is being tested for effectiveness in the treatment of Covid-19. After this intervention, Kaletra’s manufacturer AbbVie said it will not enforce its rights anywhere in the world. Gilead Sciences applied for “orphan drug” designation to US regulators for its Remdesivir antiviral drug as a potential coronavirus treatment — but backed down after public criticism.

But while billions of dollars of investment is going into the search for a cure for Covid-19, there are questions about whether the economic downturn will see struggling companies in badly affected sectors such as aviation or engineering cut back on their research and development.

An OECD report from 2012 showed that after the 2008 financial crisis there was a decline in patent filings — which are seen as a good proxy for R&D spend — from countries like Canada, Germany and the US which were badly affected by recession. Yet others like China, Japan and Korea saw rises in patent filings. In the UK, filings fell after the 2008 crisis and numbers only recovered to pre-crash levels in 2017.

Sheilla Wallace, partner at law firm Marks & Clerk, believes investment in life sciences, at least, will continue. “People are playing the long game,” she says. “Drugs invented today won’t be coming to the marketplace for 10 years.”"
M20d46,21/04/2020,mainstream,"Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story

“Chaotic” is how Jorge Contreras, a law professor at the University of Utah, describes a struggle by companies and governments to navigate intellectual property law in the urgent search for Covid-19 treatments.

When AbbVie, the US drug company, dropped its patent rights for its Kaletra antiviral drug — identified as a potential treatment for Covid-19 — it was clear that the pandemic had upended the normal rules of the pharmaceuticals sector.

AbbVie’s move came after the Israeli government issued a compulsory licence — overriding normal patent protection — to allow the sale of copycat versions of the drug. For Israel to do this, say industry executives, shows that these are not normal times: the country is the home of Teva Pharmaceuticals and has an economy that is heavily dependent on R&D.

Yet a growing number of higher-income countries — from China to Chile — have indicated that they too are prepared to issue compulsory licences to secure adequate drug supplies.

The industry views such moves with alarm. Severin Schwan, chief executive of Roche Holdings, says waiving IP “would be a disaster”. “If we don’t have IP, no one will take care of developing anything . . . Who would ever invest if there was no incentive?”

Pharmaceutical companies have responded rapidly to the need for treatments and a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. The Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) says more than a third of its 1000 members are now working on coronavirus. The trade organisation adds that surprising new collaborations are springing up — not least a vaccine development partnership between old rivals GlaxoSmithKline of the UK and Sanofi of France.

IP is not the limiting factor at this stage, says David Loew, executive vice-president at Sanofi Pasteur. “Most vaccines don’t even have IP. In the end it’s a lot down to knowhow: how you produce them, workers, quality systems.”

Changing IP rules could therefore end up doing more harm than good. “As an industry, having IP is always important,” Mr Loew said in an interview. “We are already doing tiered pricing and providing equitable access around the world. It would be very ill oriented to start breaking patents.”

Companies have quickly learned, however, that they will face a furious public backlash if they are seen to be aggressively asserting patents during a global health crisis.

Labrador Diagnostics, owned by technology investment company SoftBank, faced a media storm for launching a patent lawsuit against US start-up BioFire, which was developing diagnostic tests to detect Covid-19. Labrador backtracked after a few days and announced it would offer royalty-free licences for its patent-protected technology.

Similarly, Gilead Sciences, the biopharmaceuticals company, made a U-turn on its attempt to secure a financially advantageous “orphan drug” status for remdesivir, another potential treatment for Covid-19.

A few options are emerging to manage IP during the crisis. The University of Utah’s Prof Contreras and a group of US-based lawyers, professors and scientists have set up the Open Covid Pledge, a website where companies can quickly set up a basic licensing agreement for any coronavirus-related technologies. The project has the backing of the technology industry, including companies such as Intel.

University College London’s commercialisation business, UCLB, has also set up a rapid licensing website, initially to help distribute the blueprints for the UCL-Ventura breathing aid developed by UCL and carmaker Mercedes. It is now also open for any other inventors of Covid-19 treatments.

The Costa Rican government has also proposed the creation of a patent pool for Covid-19 treatments, similar to the Medicines Patent Pool, a UN-backed health organisation to help provide treatments for HIV/Aids, Hepatitis C and tuberculosis in lower-income countries.

A patent pool is a mechanism that allows companies to collaborate on research for treatments and often sets the prices at which they can be sold. Though it is not necessarily a quick fix, observers have said that the speed of reaction during the present pandemic has been unlike anything they have seen previously. While the MPP initially took nearly a decade to set up for other diseases, it announced earlier this month that it would temporarily expand its mandate to cover Covid-19 interventions.

Tahir Amin, of the Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge, a campaign group, says an optimal solution would be “an open-collaborative platform and partnerships where all data and technologies are made available for use by anyone in the world without the constraints of intellectual property and negotiating terms of access.”

“That will scare some people because it may reveal the many flaws of the current proprietary models that are holding up progress,” he says.

Another option might be to use public development partnerships, such as the model followed by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). The Swiss not-for-profit foundation, backed by governments and charitable foundations, funds private companies to develop treatments for malaria on the condition that they make those drugs accessible to users in developing countries at affordable prices.

“We tend to use IP as a positive — companies retain their IP and can benefit from it, but there is a responsibility that goes along with that,” says David Reddy, chief executive of MMV.

Meanwhile, pressure on the pharmaceuticals industry is only growing. A recent study by Liverpool University’s Andrew Hill and others found that Covid-19 drugs made from repurposed molecules could be produced at a profit for $1 per day. Gilead’s remdesivir could cost as little as $9 per treatment course. The company, which has distributed its drug at no cost so far as it awaits trial results, has disagreed with that costing.

Ellen ‘t Hoen, of research group Medicines Law & Policy, says those findings could rebalance negotiations between drugmakers and national health systems.

“Knowing the cost of production for Covid-19 drugs, which are largely public-sector funded, shows the level of discount possible,” she says. “When a drug costs $1 a day to make, it is easier to push back on a list price of $100 a day, enabling negotiations to be more aggressive.”

M07b29,01/10/2019,mainstream,"Novartis and Microsoft are joining forces to apply artificial intelligence to some of the most intractable problems in healthcare, in one of the most expansive tie-ups so far between big pharma and big tech.

Under one part of the five-year agreement, which will be reviewed annually, Microsoft will work on new tools intended to make it easier to apply AI to all areas of the Swiss pharmaceutical company’s business, from finance to manufacturing.

A second part of the work will focus on using deep learning — the technique that has brought the biggest recent advances in AI — to improve the speed and precision with which it develops new medicines.

Vas Narasimhan, Novartis chief executive, suggested that AI could hold particular promise in the field of personalised medicine, helping to identify subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from new treatments.

The pharma industry, initially slow to recognise the potential of digital technologies, has been picking up the pace in recent years, with companies ranging from GlaxoSmithKline to Sanofi exploring how big data can accelerate R&D.

Novartis grasped the possibilities earlier than many of its rivals and Mr Narasimhan, who took the helm almost two years ago, has set an ambition to turn it into a data science company. He said it had pooled its internal information into three large data “lakes”, overcoming the barriers that often make it hard to combine different data sets, and employs about 800 data scientists and bio-statisticians.

Mr Narasimhan said he hoped the collaboration with Microsoft would set his company apart from rivals. “My aspiration is to lead in the space,” he said, laying out a vision in which AI would power research, development, manufacturing, finance, sales and marketing and procurement. “If we can scale the technology across the value chain of the company, that will, I hope, lead to a significant differentiation over time.”

The companies will initially focus on three areas: tackling personalised therapies for the eye disease macular degeneration; cell and gene therapy; and drug design.

Joint research will take place at the Novartis campus in Switzerland and the company’s global service centre in Dublin. It will also involve Microsoft’s research labs in Cambridge under Christopher Bishop, one of the UK’s foremost machine learning experts.

The cost of discovering and commercialising a new drug has barely shifted in decades, taking an average of 14 years and costing up to $2.5bn.

Setting a three-year timescale within which the collaboration would start to show “tangible impact” across the business, Mr Narasimhan said: “I hope . . . we can make bringing down the costs of drug discovery and drug development a reality.”

He added: “We believe that by applying AI methods to our large clinical and pre-clinical data sets, we should be able to identify the ‘super-responding’ patient populations, or patient populations that uniquely respond to different medicines, which then could lead to further testing.”

In the future this could generate more personalised medicines and allow Novartis to build “a better value proposition to healthcare systems”, he suggested."
M0954d,27/05/2020,mainstream,"Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story

After taking over as chief executive of AstraZeneca in 2012, Pascal Soriot sent a team to a global life sciences conference to look for potential drug discovery partners. There were few interested takers.

“They were a bit of a joke,” says one veteran investor who attended the event. “They were going up to everyone, trying to do partnerships, but no one would listen.” AstraZeneca’s repeated failure to find new drugs to replace one-time money-spinners as patents expired was not enticing.

Seven years on, AstraZeneca has delivered one of the most striking turnrounds in global pharmaceuticals, producing a string of blockbuster cancer drugs that have catapulted it to the industry’s front ranks.

Potential partners “are not laughing now”, the investor says.

Last month AstraZeneca scored its latest success when Oxford university’s world-renowned vaccinology centre, the Jenner Institute, chose it as partner to develop and manufacture a potentially groundbreaking vaccine to fight the coronavirus pandemic. It picked the Cambridge-based drugs group despite its limited presence in the vaccine market compared with UK peer GlaxoSmithKline — which, as the world’s biggest vaccine manufacturer by sales, would have been the more obvious choice.

The decision is already paying off. Last week AstraZeneca said it had secured orders for at least 400m doses of the as yet unproven Covid-19 vaccine, as well as $1bn in funding from the US health department.

The Oxford deal represented a reversal of fortunes for the two companies, which carry the flag for Britain’s vaunted excellence in life sciences. Barely a year after being ridiculed at that conference, AstraZeneca was fighting for its survival against an opportunistic £55-a-share bid by US rival Pfizer — a battle that few investors thought it deserved to win after serial restructurings had failed to refill its drugs pipeline.

“Most investors were saying if they could get £57 or £58, we would take that — me included,” another institutional investor says.

Now, having fought off Pfizer and built global leadership in groundbreaking oncology treatments, AstraZeneca is seen as the better bet to help manufacture and commercialise a new generation of vaccines. The partnership could also give the group a foothold in a near-$60bn a year market, which between now and 2024 is predicted to grow by about 7 per cent annually. The company’s shares now trade at almost £90, and it leads the FTSE 100 index of listed UK companies.

AstraZeneca’s success has put GSK under even more pressure to demonstrate that it can pull off a similarly durable R&D-led revival after years of failing to develop a cadre of new blockbuster medicines, despite a healthy number of regulatory approvals.

“AstraZeneca’s recent transformation has certainly given them a reputation for innovation,” says Adam Barker, pharmaceuticals analyst at Shore Capital. That puts them “at the forefront of collaborators’ minds when it comes to novel therapeutics”.

The Jenner Institute’s choice will not make or break either company. GSK has a partnership with rival Sanofi of France to develop a vaccine, as well as other initiatives to tackle the virus.

But it highlights the different paths taken by the two pharma giants over the past decade, and the scale of the challenge facing GSK’s chief executive Emma Walmsley as she attempts to reverse a decade of underperformance.

A month before Mr Soriot took over, AstraZeneca’s market value stood at £36.6bn, just over half of GSK’s £70.9bn. In recent weeks it has become the UK’s most valuable company by market capitalisation, at £118bn against GSK’s £83.4bn.

The companies’ contrasting approaches may also presage the changing fortunes of Britain’s pharmaceutical sector. “It is an interesting strategic move for AstraZeneca,” says one person involved in the vaccine partnership. “It is a commitment by them to play in this field. There will be a commercial opportunity in the global health threat that governments will want to pay money for.”

By 2022, AstraZeneca is expected to return to the ranks of the world’s top 10 pharma companies thanks to its new blockbuster drugs, according to data provider EvaluatePharma. By 2026, with annual drugs sales forecast to grow at roughly twice the rate of GSK’s, it should leapfrog its UK peer, barring any transformative acquisitions.

Drug discovery is a high-stakes enterprise. Billions can be spent on bringing a drug to market. Even then, fewer than 10 per cent succeed. Productivity in the industry has scarcely improved for years.

After a golden age in the 1990s, when drug approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration shot to record levels, innovation began to stall in the early 2000s. Bernard Munos, a former executive at US drugs group Eli Lilly, found that Big Pharma’s share in drug discoveries halved between the early 1980s and 2008, despite a sharp rise in spending on research and development.

The strategies pursued by many pharma groups — GSK and AstraZeneca included — of mergers and acquisitions to create industrial-scale R&D hubs had not worked. In the UK, the pain was compounded by the fact that both GSK and AstraZeneca were later than some peers to recognise the shift from chemical-based drugs — so-called small molecule medicines — into specialised biological treatments, which have been a more successful area for R&D.

“AstraZeneca and GSK had R&D that was not adapted to the new world,” says John Bowler, manager of Schroders Global Healthcare fund.

The sluggishness of Britain’s two big pharmaceuticals champions has had consequences for UK life sciences. British scientists, second only to the US in academic citations in the field, had been at the forefront of antibody research, for example, where drugs harness the body’s immune system to fight disease. “But the Americans capitalised on it,” Mr Bowler says.

Between 2010 and 2017 productivity in the pharmaceuticals sector fell by roughly a third, according to a 2018 study by manufacturing trade body Make UK. Gross value added — a measure of goods and services produced minus the inputs — had fallen back to 2001 levels by 2017.

As early as 2012 Britain’s big pharma companies were frustrating investors. GSK’s credibility was further damaged by bribery scandals in the US and China. But only AstraZeneca responded with a change in management, poaching Mr Soriot from Switzerland’s Roche as chief executive in late 2012.

With a scientist at the helm — one who also had experience of running Genentech, one of the most innovative biotech groups and a subsidiary of Roche — AstraZeneca began to prioritise the newest areas of science, while selling off all or a share in some drugs to raise funds for research and partnerships.

That strategy helped AstraZeneca traverse a difficult period, when it had to restock its pipeline. But some investors have raised questions about the transparency of the group’s reported results. Mr Soriot came under fire from investors for some of its accounting practices including over restructuring costs, while AstraZeneca has in the past derived substantial turnover from so-called “collaboration revenue” — income derived from royalties, drug disposals and partnerships.

“We sold out 18 months ago,” says Paul Major of BB Healthcare Trust. “The simple reason was opacity around deals they were doing. It made it very difficult to value the pipeline and . . . inflated core profitability.”

Some of those concerns have since been alleviated by the return to growth of new product sales — driven by the string of blockbuster drug approvals that will deliver revenues for years to come. One of Mr Soriot’s earliest decisions was to focus on projects that had languished in the biologics division, formed as a result of the highly criticised $15bn acquisition of MedImmune in 2007.

But the masterstroke in 2016, say both analysts and investors, was the decision to shift AstraZeneca’s headquarters from Alderley Park in Cheshire to the heart of Britain’s life sciences hub in Cambridge, instantly changing the corporate atmosphere and offering immediate access to some of the world’s brightest researchers.

GSK, with its main research centre an hour’s drive away in the London commuter town of Stevenage, had chosen another route. Former chief executive Andrew Witty, an economics graduate who had risen through the commercial side, was a passionate defender of the company’s diversified toothpaste-to-vaccines model. He believed predictable revenues from the consumer health division would help to fund pharmaceuticals R&D, while also bolstering its ability to maintain the highly valued dividend.

In 2015, GSK swapped its oncology portfolio for the consumer and vaccines businesses of Novartis. In hindsight, suggests Phil Thomson, GSK head of global affairs, that strategy was flawed. “That [diversified] business model only works if the pharmaceuticals business is performing. Strengthening the pipeline had been the key need at GSK for years,” he says.

Oncology has since proven to be one of the most promising areas for novel drug development — and the driver behind AstraZeneca’s pipeline of treatments such as Tagrisso, the group’s flagship lung cancer treatment, and Lynparza, initially approved as an ovarian cancer drug.

Mr Soriot has admitted he had not counted on the oncology portfolio delivering as quickly as it did. “The fact we took a risk [on developing Lynparza] . . . and then it started moving, actually gave people hope and started building the belief that we had things in our pipeline and our research teams were better than people thought. It helped shape the culture,” Mr Soriot told the FT in an interview late last year.

Under Ms Walmsley, who took the helm in 2017, GSK is trying to rectify the mistakes of the past. The first step is the break-up of the company, due by 2022, into a consumer healthcare business and separate pharma and vaccines group. GSK aims to be a more specialised drugs company “focused on science related to the immune system, use of genetics and new technologies”.

Earlier this year Roger Connor, GSK’s head of vaccines, told the FT: “I don’t think there are many companies in the world that have the knowledge of the immune system that sits within GSK, and [we want to make sure that] in that ‘new GSK’ we completely exploit that scientific synergy between the groups.”

But some observers believe the pharma company will be small compared with other global players, and ripe for a takeover bid. To enhance its prospects, Ms Walmsley has made boosting oncology research a priority. Last year, GSK strengthened its cancer portfolio with the $5bn acquisition of US-based Tesaro and the number of oncology assets in its portfolio has doubled since 2018. However with 2019 oncology sales of £230m, it still significantly lags behind AstraZeneca’s $8.7bn.

Ms Walmsley, the former head of GSK’s consumer healthcare business, has tried to compensate for her lack of pharma expertise by surrounding herself with a team of science “rock stars”, in the words of Joe Walters, fund manager at Royal London Asset Management.

California based Hal Barron, head of R&D, was plucked from Google’s longevity start-up Calico, and had been chief medical officer at Genentech and Roche. Luke Miels, once Mr Soriot’s right-hand man at AstraZeneca, is GSK’s head of pharmaceuticals. His appointment sharpened the focus on pursuing only drugs with clear prospects of financial return after years in which its researchers had drifted off into “hobbyland”, as Ms Walmsley once told the FT.

That team has reassured investors. “Slowly but surely she is turning the group around,” says Mr Walters. Yet the team’s initial moves are now raising questions over GSK’s longer-term focus on the UK.

Dr Barron, who insisted he would remain in San Francisco to run GSK’s global R&D network, has led the deals hailed as crucial to transforming the group’s future pipeline.

As well as Tesaro, GSK has acquired a stake in West Coast-based consumer genetics testing company 23andMe and struck a five-year collaboration with the University of California San Francisco to establish a laboratory for Crispr technologies, which are used to edit genes.

While the US remains the world’s biggest and most innovative market for drugs, there are concerns that GSK’s head of R&D could be missing opportunities closer to home. “All the insights are from California, when the smartest scientists might be on your doorstep in the UK,” says Dan Mahony, co-head of healthcare investments at asset manager Polar Capital.

“You can see with the partnerships Hal has entered into the centre of gravity is shifting outwards,” says Mr Bowler.

Investors point to the opportunities offered by the UK’s single-payer NHS that cares for all Britons and which could offer significant advantages when trialling new treatments. The data gathered by a single system could help accelerate development of drugs and the competitiveness of the UK industry, says one investor.

Mr Thomson says concerns about the company’s commitment to the UK are overstated, with £1bn a year invested in R&D in the country and Stevenage one of its two main global research centres. NHS data was “a very precious asset”, he says, but would require significant investment to exploit its full potential.

The NHS is starting to make connections between clinical trials and data and UK research infrastructure such as the biobank of health data, says Mr Thomson. “Making those connect in the UK to work in a viable way that industry can then access appropriately is absolutely the next step. You are seeing elements of that. But there needs to be more. If that happened, then the UK remains very attractive to us.”

Ultimately, GSK and AstraZeneca are likely to be agnostic about geography. “They’ll both . . . source [expertise] wherever is best. Of course, part of that is who or what you know already, perhaps why Hal has looked to the US,” says Mr Barker of Shore Capital.

The more immediate challenge is the heightened risk of political interference as public health and drug discovery become questions of national security. Both companies have committed substantial resources to fighting coronavirus. Investors understand that there will be little or no financial return in the near future from these efforts. But they may help to restore the reputation — and bargaining power — of an industry that has been vilified over the pricing of critical medicines that may have been developed with the support of taxpayer-funded research.

“Big Pharma has been under unremitting pressure for the last four years,” says Mr Major. “It is an opportunity for the industry to demonstrate its worth and value to society.”"
M0cd1e,24/05/2019,mainstream,"The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved what will be the most expensive drug in the world, a gene therapy from Novartis that treats spinal muscular atrophy at a cost of $2.1m.

The price of Zolgensma, announced by Novartis right after the FDA decision, is more than twice that of the world’s second most expensive drug, Luxterna, an $850,000 treatment for blindness made by Spark Therapeutics, and recently acquired by Roche.

Zolgensma is a revolutionary treatment for a devastating inherited neuromuscular disease that causes loss of muscle function and can lead to children dying in infancy. It works by repairing the genes so that a missing protein can be produced.

Vas Narasimhan, chief executive of Novartis, said the drug is a “historic advance” and a “landmark one-time gene therapy”, and it had been priced at what he said was half the cost of existing treatments for patients with spinal muscular atrophy. These can include extensive interventions such as breathing support. Novartis said the cost of chronic therapy can often exceed $4m in the first 10 years of a child’s life.

“We believe by taking this responsible approach, we will help patients benefit from this transformative medical innovation and generate significant cost savings for the system over time,” he said.

The new therapy will compete with a treatment from Biogen, which sells its drug Spinraza at $750,000 for the first year. Biogen stock was down 1 per cent to $226.73 in mid-afternoon in New York. Shares in Novartis, which have increased by 30 per cent in the last year, were up 4.3 per cent to $88.07.

Analysts at Jefferies predict peak worldwide sales for the drug of $2.6bn a year, assuming it will be priced slightly lower outside the US, at an average of about $1.5m.

Zolgensma enters the market as pharmaceutical companies are facing intense political pressure over high drug prices from both sides of the aisle in the US. Much of the criticism has been levied because of triple digit price increases by small generics makers, but there are concerns that the healthcare system will struggle to absorb the high price tags of new advanced therapies like gene-editing.

To try to quell these concerns, Novartis has been experimenting with new drug pricing models: it will allow insurers to spread the cost of Zolgensma over five years and has signed some “outcomes-based agreements” where insurers only pay if the therapy works.

Patients in the clinical trial of Zolgensma were all under two when it started. After two years, all of the patients on a high dose were alive and not on permanent ventilation. Three quarters were able to sit without support for at least 30 seconds and two were able to stand and walk without assistance.

Ned Sharpless, acting FDA commissioner, said the approval marks “another milestone in the transformational power of gene and cell therapies to treat a wide range of diseases”. He added, “With each new approval, we see this exciting area of science continue to move beyond the concept phase into reality.”

Dave Lennon, president of AveXis, the maker of Zolgensma, which Novartis acquired last year for $8.7bn, said the company was working to get speedy decisions from governments and insurers on whether to cover the drug.

Novartis expects to receive approval for the therapy in the European Union and Japan later this year."
M1f0d5,25/06/2020,mainstream,"Sarah Singla is a cereal farmer who does not know how to plough. That is a sign not of professional laxness, but of her dedication to the conservation agriculture that her father embraced. Since taking over the 100-hectare family farm in the southern French department of Aveyron a decade ago, Ms Singla has further developed the practices he initiated in 1980.

Conservation agriculture aims to minimise or suppress tillage, ensure that soil always has a cover crop, and use crop rotation to enhance soil fertility. The advantages, says Ms Singla, are manifold: “It uses less fossil fuel and machinery; there is less erosion and more clean water and air, more nutrient-dense food, more biodiversity — and happy farmers.”

Increasing the organic content of soils, as this way of farming does, also mitigates climate change: since the organic matter comprises plant material, and organisms that feed on it, the effect is to lock away the carbon drawn from the atmosphere during photosynthesis.

Carbon capture in soil has been hailed as an underrated solution to the problem of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions.

According to the 4p1000 initiative, headquartered in the southern French city of Montpellier, the world’s soil contains 1,500 gigatonnes of carbon in the form of organic material.

“There is two to three times more carbon in the soil than there is in the atmosphere,” says Paul Luu, executive secretary of 4p1000, which was launched in 2015.

The organisation calculates that increasing that carbon stock each year by 0.4 per cent — four parts per 1,000 — would more than offset the average annual increase in CO2 emissions.

There is good evidence that changing farming practices can make a difference. Sean Smukler, chair of agriculture and environment at the University of British Columbia, has studied carbon sequestration in Canadian croplands. He points out that national-level tracking shows that by 2011 farmers in the Prairies, which make up 80 per cent of the country’s cropland, were sequestering an average of 97kg of carbon per hectare per year, a roughly tenfold increase since 1981.

Carbon capture was driven by a shift to conservation tillage, and a reduction in summertime fallows, when the land is left out of production. But one of the biggest factors was an increase of 8m hectares growing canola (rapeseed), which has extensive roots.

One study that Prof Smukler cites concluded that, if trends in the decade to 2015 continue, Canadian croplands could expect to sequester an additional 17.8m tonnes of carbon a year from 2016 to 2030. That is not so far short of the 22m tonnes per year implied for Canada by the 4p1000 target. Prof Smukler points out, however, that 22m tonnes of carbon equates to only 11 per cent of Canada’s overall CO2 emissions per year.

“We have made some substantial progress in capturing carbon,” he says, “but there is still a long way to go.”

Prof Smukler adds that “early adopters” among farmers are often concerned to ensure their practices are sustainable. But “for widespread adoption it usually requires something that is good for the bottom line”.

According to a 2017 study by the European Conservation Agriculture Federation, this type of farming can indeed boost profitability, thanks in part to reduced production costs. But because many farmers work on very thin profit margins, changing cultivation practices can be risky, especially since what works on one field might not work on its neighbour. Additionally some soils, such as peatlands, are vital to carbon storage, yet so unproductive that government subsidies may be needed to work on them.

Reaping the full economic benefits requires knowledge, investment and marketing skills. Little wonder that the trend is led by large, well-resourced farming groups which can seize the economic savings, and by enthusiasts such as Ms Singla.

One approach — now favoured by the UK government — is to pay farmers for the “environmental services” they provide. ClimateCare, a UK organisation that finances, manages and develops climate projects, has channelled funds from polluters seeking to offset their carbon emissions to farmers in the UK and elsewhere to fund the protection and restoration of peatlands that are high in organic matter.

Edward Hanrahan, chairman, says incentive payments and carbon markets can be used to motivate farmers to sequester carbon in soil. But certification is essential, and challenging. In the UK, he says, the soil “in every field, in every corner of every field, is different”.

Mr Luu, from 4p1000, agrees that soil diversity makes it technically challenging to pay farmers to sequester carbon. This year it will unveil a 30-year strategy plan, backed by measurement standards and dashboards designed to facilitate soil carbon capture schemes and measure progress toward its goals.

Over the past five years, 4p1000 has built links with 465 partner organisations ranging from the World Bank and governments to NGOs, farmers’ unions and food companies. Its aim is to shift farmers from conventional agriculture, which relies upon synthetic pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers, intensive tillage and animal husbandry. Instead, the goal is to move the sector through the conservation agriculture practised by Ms Singla and others to regenerative farming, which adds grass-fed livestock husbandry, fertilisation by manure and planting of trees to the favoured mix of techniques.

“If we can succeed in this revolution we will store a lot of carbon in our agricultural soil; we will change our way of producing food in a better direction — which is what the consumer wants — and we will get rid of mineral fertilisers,” Mr Luu says.

Ms Singla estimates that 20-30 per cent of French farmers now use minimum tillage techniques and five per cent practise conservation agriculture. She believes the numbers are poised to soar.

Why? “With conservation agriculture, we can produce better food, in a cheaper way,” she says. Heavy rains and lasting droughts are becoming more frequent. “Because our soil is healthy, we can grow a crop when our neighbours cannot enter the field [to cultivate it] because it is too wet or too dry.”

Ms Singla insists the 4p1000 target can and must be not merely achieved but surpassed. “Some carbon sequestration data from conservation agriculture farms around the world are already reaching the goal of 0.4 per cent a year,” she says. “Restoring soil fertility is urgent for everyone in our society.”"
M1fd74,01/06/2018,mainstream,"The good news is that about 40 per cent of cancer cases are preventable and that smoking, the biggest single cause, is in decline across much of the world. The bad news is that overall rates are shooting up as more countries adopt western lifestyles.

By 2035, the number of new cases is set to rise by 58 per cent to 24m, according to a report from the World Cancer Research Fund.

“Over the next 20 or 30 years, unless anything is done to stop it, [obesity or being overweight] is going to overtake smoking as the number one risk factor for cancer,” says Dr Kate Allen, executive director of science and public affairs at the WCRF.

The report is a synthesis of a decade of research on cancer risks with a new set of recommendations (see graphic) to minimise a person’s chances of developing the disease. It says 12 cancers are now linked to being overweight or obese.

“It has taken 40 or 50 years to make a big dent in tobacco consumption,” Dr Allen says. In dealing with the problems of obesity, “it’s going to take at least that to get some traction,” she adds.

Linda Bauld, professor of health policy at the University of Stirling in Scotland, says: “We still don’t fully understand all the biological mechanisms for why excess fat causes cancer.”

This should not stop obesity prevention programmes, however, receiving the same priority as anti-smoking measures, Prof Bauld adds. “We have very poor provision of weight management services. The NHS and others really need to step up.”

Scotland is taking a lead on prevention. Around four in 10 cancer cases among its population could be prevented by changes in lifestyle, according to a paper in the British Journal of Cancer.

Scotland’s devolved government is planning to restrict the sale of crisps and biscuits, force calorie counts to be printed on food packaging and to clamp down on television advertising of junk food as part of proposals to halve child obesity by 2030.

It has introduced the world’s first minimum unit price for alcohol— a class-one carcinogen — and has been at the forefront of banning smoking in public places.

Cancer prevention strategies are especially important in poorer countries where cases are often diagnosed too late and options for treatment are limited.

Tobacco provides a sobering example. Prof Bauld, who is also deputy director at the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, says the number of adult males smoking in the UK has dropped from 80 per cent in the 1950s to less than 16 per cent.

By contrast in low-income regions such as Africa, the rate is increasing. “Those markets are newer,” she says. “And a lot of the policies we’ve put in place through the [World Health Organisation’s] Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in high-income countries are not in place in low-income countries.”

Prof Bauld adds: “One of the successes in tobacco control is that there’s been a very clear enemy, but it has become much more complicated. The advent of vaping and alternatives to traditional cigarettes have enabled some tobacco companies to recast themselves as part of the solution.”

Ecigarettes are generally viewed more favourably by regulators in the UK as a way of weaning people off smoking, but in the US they are seen as a gateway to traditional cigarettes.

“Globally the tobacco industry is very powerful, often in bed with governments, and has managed to push back on high taxes, visible health warnings and smoke-free laws,” Prof Bauld says.

Adhering to the WCRF’s cancer prevention recommendations will have a “double or triple whammy”, says Dr Allen, namely in reducing the risk not just of cancer but of other chronic diseases.

Public authorities, however, have been called upon to play their part. Dr Allen says: “We need governments to enact policy so that the environment works with people and not against them, so they can make healthier choices more easily.”

Awareness campaigns are another crucial policy component. A study funded by Cancer Research UK shows a poor public understanding of the causes of cancer and a growing number of speculative assertions or misconceptions — often spread online — that conditions such as stress are a cause of the disease.

Some dangers, such as air pollution, are beyond the control of the individual. “Non-smoking lung cancer is a very under-appreciated condition,” says Jonathan Grigg, one of the authors of a 2016 report for the Royal College of Physicians on the long-term impact of air pollution.

Its carcinogenic effects have only really come to public attention in the past 10 years or so. Prof Grigg, who is also a founder of the Doctors Against Diesel campaign launched in 2016, says mitigation efforts by cities such as London are laudable but far too unambitious.

Policies in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands are much bolder, he suggests. Their combination of anti-pollution measures and the encouragement of “active travel”, such as walking and cycling, “could really make a big difference to people’s lives and also reduce things like cancer and cardiovascular risk”.

The WHO has sought to shift the international perception of air pollution as an environmental problem to being viewed as a public health priority. It has expanded its BreatheLife campaign to monitor air quality in 4,000 cities, highlighting the fact that nine out of 10 people worldwide do not breathe safe air.

Vaccination also has a role to play in preventing certain cancers such as those caused by the human papillomavirus, which is sexually transmitted and responsible for 5 per cent of cases worldwide.

Most countries inoculate only girls against HPV but there is pressure from campaign groups such as HPV Action in the UK for “gender-neutral vaccination”. English health authorities have extended immunisation to men who have sex with men.

As with other chronic diseases, cancer prevention makes economic sense. Faced with huge increases in cases and rocketing medical costs, “no country can afford to treat its way out of the problem,” says the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer.

“There must be an integrated approach, balancing prevention and treatment: embracing each, neglecting neither,” the agency adds. “Unfortunately, current investment in cancer prevention research and the implementation of preventive interventions is too low.”"
M1b2f5,07/02/2014,mainstream,"Colombia’s capital, Bogotá, has had a reputation for kidnapping, contract killing and cocaine trafficking since the 1970s. Violence has forced affluent professionals to flee the city and thwarted the country’s efforts to attract foreign investment.

For many years, the historic La Candelaria district was seen as one of the most dangerous parts of the city. Rife with drugs and gun crime, the cobbled streets and crumbling colonial buildings were often squalid, and deemed to be among the worst places in the city to invest in property.

Yet La Candelaria is now at the centre of a surprising renaissance sweeping through much of this sprawling South American metropolis: churches, government buildings and museums have been renovated; parks and plazas have been cleaned up and now bustle with tourists.

Crime has been curbed considerably. The murder rate in Bogotá is at a 27-year low, according to the Colombian Ministry of Defence: it dropped to 32 murders per 100,000 residents in 2012 – down from nearly 60 in 2003 and 80 in 1993.

Kidnappings, a favourite weapon of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc), have also declined substantially.

“Cutting crime is having a positive effect on property investment,” says Sam Miller, director-general of Colombia International Real Estate, an estate agency that caters for international property investors. “Safety and security are especially important to foreign buyers, so significantly reducing crime is part of the city’s success.”

This revitalisation is helping Bogotá shed its narcostate image and persuading property buyers that the culturally vibrant city is safe for investment. After several years of double-digit growth, house prices have increased around 8 to 10 per cent per year for the past three years, estimates Angel Seda, founder and chief executive of Royal Property Group, a real estate development firm.

“The luxury sector, in particular, is expanding,” says Seda, a native of Los Angeles, California, who began selling real estate in Colombia in 2004. He launched a full-service property investment firm last year.

“Areas of Bogotá that were off-limits just a few years ago are now full of tourists and gaining investment,” he says.

Colombia’s strengthening economy is also lifting Bogotá’s property market, while swelling the ranks of the country’s wealthy. Per capita income across the country grew from around $4,400 per person in 2000 to over $6,990 per person in 2012, according to World Bank figures.

The prospering economy is creating millionaires faster than in Mexico or Brazil, according to WealthInsight, a research company. Fourteen-thousand new millionaires were created over the past five years, putting Colombia’s total millionaire population at 35,900 at the end of 2012. That is a rise of 49 per cent since 2007, WealthInsight data shows.

With just under 8m inhabitants, Bogotá is Colombia’s most populous city and the second-largest city in South America.

Surrounded by the Andes mountains, the city sits 8,612ft above sea level, affording many unobstructed mountain views and relatively consistent temperatures throughout the year. The average temperature in summer is about 18C.

La Cabrera, Santa Barbara and Rosales to the north and Seminar and Usaquen towards the northeastern hills of the city are among Bogotá’s most expensive areas for property.

New condominium developments in these districts can range in price between $5,200 and $9,300 per sq metre depending on the size and location of the home, says Verónica Dávila, an estate agent with Julio Corredor & Cia, an affiliate of Christie’s International Real Estate. Renovated single-family homes in these districts generally range in price from $4,600 to $7,250 per sq metre, Dávila says.

Engel & Völkers is marketing a four-bedroom, four-bathroom home in the Santa Barbara district for $2.89m. The house measures 5,629 sq ft with an additional 78 sq ft of terrace space which has unobstructed views of the Cordillera Oriental, the widest of the three branches of the Colombian Andes.

The residence sits in a condominium complex that includes a swimming pool, tennis court and security system, according to Vanina Orellana, an estate agent with Engel & Völkers.

A five-bedroom apartment in the Montearroyo district is on the market for $2.49m with Century 21 Global. It measures 700 sq metres with eight bathrooms and private parking for up to five vehicles. The home has 9ft high ceilings and hardwood flooring throughout. It also has a wine cellar and a private terrace with views of the city.

Like any big city, homelessness and street crime still bedevil parts of Bogotá. Higher crime areas include the low-rent districts of Corabastos and El Bronx, where petty crime and drugs remain a problem, estate agents say.

The UK Foreign Office and the US Department of State still warn its citizens to be vigilant when travelling in parts of the capital and in Colombia as a whole. And, although the language in these warnings is milder than in the past, the US State Department says violence linked to narco-trafficking continues to affect some rural areas and parts of large cities.
• There are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Bogotá
• Colombian banks expect a deposit worth 30 to 40 per cent of the property’s total value
• Interest rates at Colombian banks are about 16 per cent
• Commissions for real estate agents range between 3 and 5 per cent of the purchase price and are paid by the seller

M1d4ae,15/11/2013,mainstream,"After John F Kennedy was murdered on November 22 1963, Dallas became known as “the city of hate”. Its citizens were charged with creating a fervid rightist atmosphere in which Lee Harvey Oswald felt moved to shoot the president. Mike Rawlings, the city’s current mayor, told me: “There are stories of people going to places and almost being embarrassed to be from Dallas back in the 1960s, early 1970s.”

I found Rawlings sneaking a catnap at the New Cities Summit in São Paulo in June. The man who came to Dallas in 1976 with $200 in his pocket and made it to president of Pizza Hut was taking the briefest break from his usual activity: plugging Dallas. But how does any city incorporate a global trauma into its image? It’s taken Dallas 50 years to learn to deal with the murder.

Many Americans in 1963 couldn’t accept that a lone loser like Oswald had changed history. Consequently, they blamed larger entities. Conspiracy theorists accused the Central Intelligence Agency or Cuban exiles. Others blamed Dallas itself.

To quote Texas Monthly magazine: “The tragedy seemed to seal the perception of our state as being populated by a bunch of trigger-happy yeehaws who were beyond forgiveness.” Because few outsiders knew anything else about Dallas, the assassination branded the city. In truth, Dallas in 1963 did house some noisy rightist Kennedy-haters. Days before he arrived, “Wanted for Treason” leaflets featuring him appeared around town. And on the day, the Dallas Morning News published an ominously black-bordered full-page ad portraying him as a communist fellow-traveller. Reading it, Kennedy told his wife: “We’re heading into nut country today.”

After the murder, many diagnosed citywide hate. Bill Minutaglio, co-author of the new book Dallas 1963, says: “Nothing like this could have happened, but in Dallas.”

Yet blaming Dallas is illogical. Oswald was a Marxist nut, not a rightwing nut. And as Rawlings says, “Dallas loves its presidents.” Nearly one in three Dallasites turned out to see Kennedy, with barely an unfriendly sign on display. In the motorcade, the Texan governor’s wife, Nellie Connally, gushed, “Mr President, you can’t say Dallas doesn’t love you.” She was mostly right. Assassinations, Americans soon learnt, can happen anywhere. Cities don’t kill people. People kill people.

After 1963, says Rawlings, many Dallasites “wanted to move on as quickly as possible”. They rarely discussed the murder. Gradually, though, the mood changed. Rawlings says: “In the 1980s, people started to think: we are the home of a very important moment in history. Not only because of the assassination, but that seemed to be the dawning of a new era. After that came the Vietnam war, civil rights came to its fruition, women’s liberation. There was a new world, a door that somehow people walked through. Citizens said, ‘We’ve got to make sure we capture the truth of this history.’”

Oswald had shot from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. Plans to tear the building down were dropped. In 1989 it became a museum. Rawlings says, “For many years it was the one site that if someone visited you and said, ‘What do you want to do in the afternoon?’ you would say, ‘Want to go down to the Sixth Floor Museum?’”

He adds: “I don’t think we should be defensive or try to remove anything. It is what it is. That part of history will always be in Dallas.” Even Oswald, says Rawlings, belongs in the city’s history. He attended elementary school in Dallas, and returned in 1962 after his Soviet jaunt.

The city can face these facts today largely because the assassination’s stigma has faded. Rawlings says: “With time that changed, with the arrival of the Dallas Cowboys [football team] and different things that Dallas started to become known for. It became a secondary branding for the city.”

On Friday, the world will be watching Dallas. Rawlings says: “Before I became mayor, I realised that the one moment people were going to pay more attention to Dallas while I was mayor was November 22 2013. People look to 50th anniversaries. They remember where they were, and you retell the story.” Friday’s commemoration will be sober and “very untouristy”, he adds. “I’m very shy about trying to do too much on this day. If I can stand up straight, salute the president and move on, I think Dallas has done what’s right. Our brand won’t be made because of this.”

Where was Rawlings on November 22 1963? “In elementary school in Leawood, Kansas. They moved us to the gymnasium, and I remember sitting Indian-style on the floor when the principal told us, and we were sent home. My mother was a teacher, and before she passed away she gave me a stack of letters that she had had her elementary-school grade write about their reflections on that weekend. It was marvellous. Just a bunch of kids in a random school in Kansas talking about this shows the depth and breadth of this moment in people’s lives.”

M168c2,01/06/2018,mainstream,"When the first cancer immunotherapies were introduced in 2014, oncologists hailed them as the biggest advance since the advent of chemotherapy in the 1950s.

But that early enthusiasm soon gave way to frustration: while the drugs appear to work remarkably well in some patients — such us those with melanoma or a subset of lung cancer sufferers — most patients derive no benefit at all.

Now drugmakers are engaged in a race to combine the drugs, known as PD1 checkpoint inhibitors, with other medicines, in an attempt to open up the benefits of immunotherapy to more patients.

The most notable success has been Merck & Co’s checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda, in combination with chemotherapy. When given together, the two medicines can dramatically boost survival rates in patients with the most common type of lung cancer, according to a large, late-stage trial published in April.

Patients who received Keytruda in addition to chemotherapy were 51 per cent less likely to die during the trial than those on chemotherapy alone, the study of 616 participants found.

Regulators in the US approved the combination of Keytruda with chemotherapy last year, based on promising results from a smaller study that was not designed to detect whether the regimen could boost survival.

However, the treatment is expected to become more widely adopted after the data from the larger trial. European regulators — who declined to approve the treatment based on the small study — are also expected to give it a green light.

Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s most senior scientist, says he was “kind of stunned” by the results from the study. “If you look at all the traditional sensitivity measures like age, sex, and smoking, the combination is better, and meaningfully better, for everyone.”

The combination also benefited patients with tumours that had low levels of a protein known as programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1.

For reasons that are not completely understood, patients with cancers that express high levels of this protein tend to do well on immunotherapies, while those with low levels do not.

Dr Perlmutter suggests that the chemotherapy acts as a kind of “pro-inflammatory” agent when it kills cancerous cells, and encourages tumours to release a substance that prompts the body’s immune system to attack.

Merck’s decision to test its drug in combination with chemotherapy will help it open a lead over Bristol-Myers Squibb, its closest rival in the field of immunotherapy.

Timothy Anderson, an analyst at Bernstein, says the results of the trial “confirm that Merck will remain in the driver’s seat in terms of immunotherapy . . . in the all-important first-line lung cancer market”.

That said, Merck also made a big bet on a once-promising combination that turned out to be a flop. Early trials had suggested that adding an experimental medicine called epacadostat to Keytruda could boost the number of patients who responded to immunotherapy — and without the side effects so often associated with chemotherapy.

However, the combination failed to boost survival rates in a large study of melanoma patients that was published in April. The bad news prompted Merck and Incyte, the biotech group that makes epacadostat, to cancel or scale back other trials of the combination.

Apart from checkpoint inhibitors, the most exciting area of immunotherapy has been a pioneering treatment known as chimeric antigen receptor therapy or Car-T.

The process involves extracting a patient’s blood cells, re-engineering them in a laboratory so that they can identify and destroy cancer cells, and then re-inserting them into the patient’s body.

Two versions of Car-T, made by Gilead and Novartis, are on the market after trials of the treatments showed they could extend the lives of even the sickest blood cancer patients — some of whom had been given just weeks to live.

An experimental version, being tested by Johnson & Johnson and Nanjing Legend, a Chinese biotech group, has shown promise in patients with multiple myeloma.

However, the laborious manufacturing process, which involves producing a bespoke Car-T for each patient, has resulted in some of the highest prices for treatment in the history of drugmaking. Novartis charges $475,000 for a round of Car-T.

The high price and cumbersome production means the treatments will probably be used only for the most severe patients, according to analysts.

Pharma executives have identified two ways of potentially speeding things up. The use of robotic technology to automate the process, which is still largely done manually by scientists in a lab, could lower costs and cut the time it takes to make a Car-T.

Some companies are investigating an off-the-shelf Car-T product made using cells from a cell bank rather than a patient’s own cells. This approach is known as allogeneic and it would be much cheaper than the so-called autologous process that has been used thus far.

“The Car-T technology is moving very quickly,” says Peter Lebowitz, global head of oncology at Janssen, the drugmaking unit of Johnson & Johnson. “There are a number of variables — autologous versus allogeneic and automation — and all of those pieces are moving at a rapid pace.”

The most advanced effort to find a one-size-fits all solution is being led by Cellectis, a French biotech company, which is developing a version codenamed UCART19. If it succeeds in trials, it could provide a blueprint for further off-the-shelf treatments, meaning that existing versions, which seem so futuristic, would soon become obsolete."
M1f98b,02/09/2019,mainstream,"A personalised immune treatment for cancer, developed at University College London, has given “very promising results” in its first clinical trial on children with previously incurable leukaemia.

The therapy is a “living medicine” in a new class known as Car-T. It involves extracting immune cells from the patient, genetically engineering them in the lab to recognise the cancer cells, and then infusing them back into the bloodstream.

Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London treated 14 children with incurable acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the most common cause of cancer death in people aged under 18. They had exhausted all normal treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and bone marrow transplants, and were expected to die very soon.

The results, published in Nature Medicine, showed that 12 of the 14 patients cleared their disease within three months, although in seven there was some recurrence. Five have remained free of leukaemia. Two did not go into remission.

The experimental Car-T therapy, known as CAT-19 or Auto1, was discovered at UCL Cancer Institute and is being commercialised by Autolus, a biotech spinout from UCL. The first Car-T product to reach the UK market, Kymriah from Novartis of Switzerland, has been available on the National Health Service for a year to treat a tightly defined group of ALL patients.

According to the Great Ormond Street Hospital researchers, the clinical trial results suggest that CAT-19 is superior to Kymriah in two respects. First, said Professor Persis Amrolia, it avoids a frequent and serious side-effect of Kymriah, called cytokine release syndrome, when the immune system goes into overdrive following treatment. CRS causes a high fever and often requires the patient to receive intensive care.

The other advantage is that CAT-19’s engineered immune cells seem to persist for longer in the patients than other Car-T therapies, enabling the body to resist any recurrence of the cancer for years after treatment.

“The safety profile emerging from this paediatric study is encouraging,” said lead author Sara Ghorashian. “It is very promising to see these strong remission rates and excellent Car-T cell expansion and persistence.”

One patient who has been saved by the new treatment is 10-year-old Austin, who has suffered from ALL since the age of two. By the time he was eight all treatments available then had failed.

“When Austin relapsed for a fourth time, we thought we had exhausted every last option,” said his father Scott Sweeney. “He had the cells at GOSH in October 2016 and, two and a half years later, Austin is doing so well . . . Every night he is at the scooter park with his friends. It is lovely to see him full of energy.”

Altogether, UCL is running nine early-stage clinical trials of Car-T, including one using the same CAT-19 therapy in adult ALL patients.

“Car-T therapy is a fantastic example of using the power of the immune system to specifically target cancer cells,” said Prof Amrolia. “We’re just at the beginning of this new treatment and over the next few years I hope we can refine it further.”"
M0d8d4,02/06/2019,mainstream,"AstraZeneca has unveiled data suggesting that its push into early-stage treatments for cancer is yielding results, as the drugmaker seeks to lead a global race to increase survival rates.



Having initially fallen behind competitors in developing immunotherapy treatments for metastatic cancer, AstraZeneca has over recent years sought to carve out a niche in devising approaches effective at earlier stages of the disease.



In an interview at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago, where the company released the results of a series of clinical trials, Pascal Soriot, chief executive, said the strategy is now paying off.

He said that new technologies designed to detect cancer earlier — such as liquid biopsy tests — would make a “huge difference”, potentially curing cancer or making it manageable as a chronic disease such as HIV.

Mr Soriot added many competitors were still focused on improving survival rates for stage four cancer — often considered a terminal diagnosis — rather than targeting earlier stages where the likelihood of survival is higher.



“If you’re diagnosed early, in stage one, two, then your survival rate is 80, 85 per cent,” he said. “So then you can lift that and potentially cure patients.”



Among AstraZeneca’s headline presentations at Asco was data showing that Imfinzi, an immuno-oncology medicine, was prolonging the lives of lung cancer patients whose disease had reached the third stage.

Astra said that Imfinzi was the only immunotherapy to demonstrate overall survival at three years in “unresectable” Stage III non-small cell lung cancer. The term refers to tumours that cannot be completely excised through surgery.

The study showed that 57 per cent of patients were still alive after three years, compared with 43.5 per cent taking a placebo. Both groups had already received chemotherapy.





The company also announced the results of a study, carried out jointly with the US pharma giant Merck, on Lynparza, another drug in its cancer portfolio. The study holds promise for treating pancreatic cancer, one of the most intractable forms of the disease.

In 2017 Astra and Merck agreed to collaborate in developing and commercialising the medicine.

The trial tested Lynparza tablets as a “first-line” — or initial — maintenance treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with a particular genetic mutation, whose disease had not progressed following chemotherapy.

Results from the trial showed a “statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement” in the time patients could live without their disease getting worse, compared with those on a placebo. This reduced the risk of the disease progressing or of death by 47 per cent. 



The median time patients treated with Lynparza went without their disease worsening was 7.4 months compared with 3.8 months for those on a placebo. More than twice as many patients had seen no deterioration in their condition both one year and two years after starting to take the medicine.



José Baselga, who leads oncology R&D for Astra, said: “These unprecedented results raise new hope for patients that have seen little progress over a long period of time.”"
M08991,30/01/2020,mainstream,"A drug molecule invented entirely by artificial intelligence is set to enter human clinical trials for the first time, marking a critical milestone for the role of machine learning in medicine.

The new compound, which has been designed to treat patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, was developed by Oxford-based AI start-up Exscientia in collaboration with the Japanese pharmaceutical firm Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma.

In a sharp acceleration of the typical path to drug development, which can take about four and a half years, the AI-designed compound reached the point of entering clinical trials within just 12 months.

The breakthrough comes at a time when investors are pouring billions of dollars into companies that are accelerating drug development using AI. On average it costs about $2.6bn to develop a new treatment by traditional methods, but the use of AI could make drug discovery faster, cheaper and more effective for patients with a range of illnesses from cancers to heart disease.

So far, machine learning algorithms, combined with troves of patient data, have been used to successfully expand the number and types of patients who can benefit from existing medicines. But the invention of entirely new drugs by AI that are both clinically safe and effective in humans has been harder to achieve.

“The design and development of molecules through medicinal chemistry has always been a slow and laborious process,” said Sir John Bell, the Regius professor of medicine at Oxford university, who was not involved with the research. “Exscientia can do this in many fewer steps, which is really impressive, and it comes from very sound scientific principles. I think they are a real asset to have in the UK.”

Exscientia’s AI platform used a suite of algorithms to decide on the best chemical structure for the new compound, which is known as DSP-1181 and is targeted at a specific receptor in the brain involved in OCD. Together the algorithms were able to generate tens of millions of potential molecules, sift through the candidates and make a decision about which ones to synthesise and test.

“The AI can learn faster than conventional approaches, so we had to make and test only 350 compounds, a fifth of the normal number of compound candidates, which is record-breaking productivity,” said Andrew Hopkins, chief executive of the start-up and a molecular biophysicist. “The algorithms . . . can be applied to any drug targets, against a huge range of diseases in oncology, cardiovascular and rare diseases.”

The 60-person start-up is working with other pharmaceutical companies including Bayer and Sanofi to design new drugs for other conditions such as metabolic disease, and has raised $43m from Bristol-Myers Squibb, among others.

Toru Kimura, senior executive research director of Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, added: “We are very excited with the results of the joint research . . . We will continue to work hard to make this clinical study a success so that it may deliver new benefits to patients as soon as possible.”"
M0aa6d,29/04/2020,mainstream,"Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story

When Norway’s public health experts began looking into the backgrounds of those infected by coronavirus, they made a startling discovery: people born in Somalia have infection rates more than 10 times above the national average.

The Scandinavian country has just over 7,500 Covid-19 cases, equivalent to 140 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to data released on Tuesday. But 453 of those cases have been among the relatively small community living in Norway who were born in Somalia, a rate of 1,586 per 100,000.

“You would hear of an uncle who had been hospitalised and that this family has been infected,” said Ayan Bashir Sheikh-Mohamed, a doctor of Somali origin living in Oslo who was among the first to alert the authorities to the worryingly high death rate. “It felt like there was a lot of people.”

Norway is far from the only country where people from black and minority ethnic (Bame) groups have been disproportionately affected. People from a Bame background make up about 13 per cent of the UK population but account for a third of virus patients admitted to hospital critical care units. Black Americans represent around 14 per cent of the US population but 30 per cent of those who have contracted the virus.

Inquiries into why racial minorities are so heavily over-represented among those suffering from Covid-19 are under way, although few expect simple answers. Health experts and academics are now searching for clues among the multiple medical, socio-economic, behavioural, cultural, environmental and biological factors that could be driving the association between Covid-19 and ethnicity.

“When we started to raise the alarm about four weeks ago some people thought it was scaremongering,” said Kamlesh Khunti, professor of primary care diabetes and vascular medicine at Leicester University in the UK. “Now we see that more than 70 per cent of healthcare professionals who have died in the UK have been from Bame backgrounds.”

Similar patterns showing disproportionate numbers of Bame virus victims have emerged in the US and other European countries with large minority populations, although Prof Khunti said none had as strong evidence as the UK about overall ethnic patterns of Covid-19. France, another country with a large Bame proportion, prohibits the gathering of statistics based on ethnicity.

“We in the UK are in a position to alert the world to what is happening,” said Prof Khunti.

In the US, data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is incomplete. But it shows that white people accounted for 51 per cent of Covid-19 cases whose race was specified, compared with 74 per cent of the US population.

One factor being investigated is comorbidity. Jerome Adams, US surgeon general who is African American, has warned how the community is at greater risk because of higher rates of underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity that make people more vulnerable to Covid-19.

African Americans also tend to be poorer and less able to socially distance because of the type of work they do and where they live. People from minority communities often live more closely together than in the general population, with extended families mingling in crowded conditions.

They are also more concentrated in public-facing jobs such as transport and delivery, as well as health and social care, where they risk greater exposure to the virus. “For many reasons people from Bame backgrounds may find it difficult to maintain social distancing,” said Prof Khunti.

Many of the same reasons probably explain the high rates of infection in the Somali community in Norway. They are generally poorer and live in tight family units. Many work as taxi drivers, and could have driven the skiers returning from their Alpine holidays, which was the source of most early cases in Norway.

Trude Margrete Arnesen, a specialist at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, flagged the added difficulty of being able to deliver advice. “Everybody else is marinated in information on Covid-19 from morning to evening but not groups that do not tune in to mainstream media,” she said.

Dr Sheikh-Mohamed, the Oslo doctor, agreed the authorities made a mistake by relying solely on written material that many in the Somali community could not understand. She and a friend had a YouTube channel that they used for public health videos in Somali and soon had posted several about coronavirus, including one on washing hands that went viral, as well as a telephone hotline.

In the past few weeks, the number of infections has begun to fall among Norwegian-Somalis, leading Dr Sheikh-Mohamed to call her campaign a success. “The seriousness of this illness has really struck people,” she said.

While genetics has been mentioned as a possible contributing factor that makes some ethnic groups more susceptible to the virus, this explanation was ruled out by Ewan Birney, the director of the European Bioinformatics Institute, part of the European Molecular Biology Lab.

“After the obvious large differences in comorbidities and socio-economic status between ethnic groups, genetic effects — which might have some effect between individuals — are very unlikely to contribute to the average between-group effects,” he said.

An international research effort is under way to examine genetic differences that make some people more likely than others to be infected with the virus or to develop severe symptoms.

The UK government has also commissioned several studies to investigate Covid-19 in ethnic minorities, but clear reasons have yet to emerge. “From the first two or three I have not seen any great consistency of analysis,” Sir Patrick Vallance, the country’s chief scientist, said at a briefing this week. “I don’t have an explanation.”

M1f372,22/01/2020,mainstream,"If there has been a single big idea over the decades that has underpinned the World Economic Forum, it is the notion of replacing international conflict with inter­national commerce.

For the organisers and most of the delegates at the WEF — which this year notches up its 50th anniversary — globalisation is a positive force, reducing poverty, creating common interests between nations and allowing the spread of technologies that can tackle complex problems like disease and environmental degradation.

The forum’s external critics have long regarded this vision as glib and delusional. They argue that it has provided rhetorical cover for a global system that has increased inequality and prioritised profit over the welfare of the planet.

Amid a backlash against globalisation, rising tensions between great powers and increasing anxiety about the environment, the image of international plutocrats gathering in a Swiss mountain resort for a week of meetings and parties, is more provocative than ever.

The rucksacks handed out to Davos delegates bear the conference slogan “committed to improving the state of the world”. WEF detractors tend to believe that a better slogan would be “committed to protecting the interests of the global elite”.

At a time of increasing populism, a number of world leaders who might once have been expected to embrace the Davos gospel have taken to denouncing it. In the US, advisers to Donald Trump have labelled their ideological enemies “the party of Davos”. The US president himself rails against “globalism”. This year, Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, is making a point of not attending Davos, in favour of working on his domestic agenda.

But the critics of Davos are as capable of hypocrisy as the delegates. They are often one and the same people. Mr Trump loves to attend Davos and is scheduled to appear again this year.

It is not just the demonstrators outside the WEF tent and the populist politicians inside it that are posing severe challenges to the Davos vision. Events out in the real world also seem to be conspiring to undermine the idea that globalisation and capitalism are unstop­pable forces “improving the state of the world”.

This year’s forum takes place against a background of political fires in the Middle East and real fires in Australia. Such circumstances are likely to ensure that geopolitical and environmental concerns overshadow the economic and business questions that dominate WEF’s agenda in calmer times.

The Trump administration’s killing of Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s most feared military commander, has dramatically increased the risk of further conflict in the Middle East — a region already contending with wars in Syria, Yemen and (at a lower level) Libya. The big new danger is of a direct clash between the US and Iran. If that now comes to pass, it will have serious implications for the stability of the whole Gulf region, a crucial source of both energy and capital for the wider global economy.

If the US finds itself drawn into another military conflict in the Middle East, it will run directly counter to Mr Trump’s promise to pull the US out of “endless wars” in the area. It will also undermine his administration’s attempt to refocus US foreign policy on great-power competition and trade.

For some months, it has been clear that Mr Trump wants to call an end, or at least a sustainable truce, to his trade war with China. The announcement of a “phase one” trade deal between the US and China has seen tariffs frozen — and the Chinese commit to making large purchases of US goods.

In the crucial field of technology, however, it looks as if the “decoupling” between the Chinese and US economies is set to continue.

Washington’s intent to thwart the global ambitions of Huawei, China’s mobile communications champion — as well as China’s longstanding obstacles to US technology companies like Google and Facebook — is increasingly leading to the creation of two quite separate technology universes. That has big implications for international trade and the vision of a single, interconnected global economy.

The decoupling of the world’s two largest economies also has geopolitical ramifications. While the Davosian perspective that more global commerce means less global conflict was always a little oversimplified, it is quite possible that the opposite would be the case — namely that the severing of US and Chinese economic ties will hasten their slide into strategic rivalry.

The fact that Davos takes place in the heart of Europe has often allowed European politicians to take centre stage and to shape the forum’s agenda. However, leading European politicians are less well-placed than in previous years to make a splash at the WEF.

French President Emmanuel Macron, whose internationalist agenda tends to go down well at Davos, is preoccupied by domestic labour unrest. Angela Merkel, German chancellor, is coming to the end of her period in power.

There will, however, be considerable interest in the likely appearance of the new head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. Her promises to create a “geopolitical commission”, and to carve out a distinctive European role in the global argument over technology regulation, will be examined closely.

The rise in international trade tensions and the risk of war in the Middle East will further exasperate environmental activists. They feel that global leaders are simply concentrating on the wrong issues.

To be fair to Davos enthusiasts, last year’s WEF featured a heavy emphasis on the environment. The British natural historian Sir David Attenborough and Swedish activist Greta Thunberg put in high-profile appearances.

But acknowledging the importance of environmental issues and creating positive change are rather different things. When WEF was still preoccupied with the joys of globalisation, Davos was an effective place to make things happen. The forum served as a sort of high-minded dating agency, with business people, financiers and political leaders able to co-operate to facilitate the growth of trade and investment.

It is far less evident that the same types of people can work together to find global solutions to pressing environmental matters.

Corporations, for example, will talk about putting “sustainability” at the heart of their businesses. For their part, financiers will stress the need to incorporate climate considerations into their risk models. At the same time, most politicians (though not Mr Trump) may pay lip-service to the need for international co-operation to combat the dangers.

All three groups will continue to applaud activists like Ms Thunberg. The suspicion could well remain, however, that nothing much of substance will happen.

When it comes to the climate crisis, the old debates about whether Davos is a force for good or ill in the world might not apply. The forum may be neither part of the problem, nor part of the solution. It risks simply being irrelevant."

The rules-based global order as we know it is on life support. It is under threat in an increasingly multi-popular world — fragmented and weakened in its ability to tackle the challenges of the future. Few think there is now anyway back to multilateralism and a new approach is in order.

Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Jean-Claude Trichet, John B Taylor, Min Zhu and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala from the G20 eminent persons group argue that a new co-operative international order can tackle the unprecedented challenges facing the world.

National policies must be at the heart of tackling these challenges, the authors say. International initiatives must support innovation, financial stability and investment while avoiding “beggar-thy-neighbour” policies that benefit one country.

M0c23d,06/03/2020,mainstream,"With her shiny gloves, tightly corseted waist and cut-away bodices, the woman of French couture legend Thierry Mugler’s imagination is an otherworldly creature. In a new book, Thierry Mugler, Photographer, this fantasy female comes to life in photographs taken by the designer himself, many of them previously unpublished. Through Mugler’s images, we see the couture as he does: futuristic and alien. One model is captured in skintight metallic lamé on the sand dunes of the Algerian Sahara; another in a black feathered gown, standing against the ice caps of Greenland. Here, in a wry moment of literalism, the model is dressed as a fluffy neon alien with the Cabazon Dinosaurs roadside attraction in California looming behind."
M09ba7,08/09/2016,mainstream,"A blustery wind whipped through Venice as the annual film festival entered its second week. It gusted over the slither of land that hosts the event and up the red carpet, sending hairdos and dresses swirling and causing the occasional wardrobe malfunction — to say nothing of carelessly pasted toupees. And with it other elements blew in: stormy relationships, winds of war and some serious hot air from across the cosmos.

One thing that continued from the first week was the preponderance of strong female leads. With one former US First Lady very much in the news spotlight, another is put under the microscope in the robust biopic Jackie. Natalie Portman stars as the west’s most famous widow in a film that does not purport to tell her life story but focuses on the days following JFK’s assassination.

As in last year’s paedophile priest drama The Club, Chilean director Pablo Larraín doesn’t flinch from the facts. We see Jackie in the immediate aftermath of the shooting: blood-spattered, still wearing the famous pink Chanel suit and refusing to change. We are spared the actual moment of horror but that too arrives later. We also get the pill-popping, the drink and references to JFK’s serial infidelity. Portman wanders through it all, alternating between glassy detachment and aching vulnerability. In flashbacks and a recreated TV special we see how she carefully curated the White House and with it the Kennedy public image and come to understand why she later struggled in vain to stage-manage her husband’s legacy.

This Jackie is complex, stoic and stubborn, flashing the steel that underpinned her stately exterior when speaking to the press, confiding in Bobby (Peter Sarsgaard) and confessing profound inner doubts to her priest (John Hurt). Portman captures the slightly stiff gait and the mid-Atlantic drawl, though the breathy, soporific delivery she adopts at times brings to mind — of all people — Marilyn Monroe. At 35, Portman’s beauty is starting to be contoured by life experience in a way that is bringing new depths to her performances.

Mel Gibson too knows a thing or two about living in the public eye. In recent years he has been better known for his personal indiscretions than his movies but he breaks few rules in Hacksaw Ridge. Returning to the director’s chair a decade after the Mayan epic Apocalypto, he tells the true story of conscientious objector turned decorated second world war hero Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield).

The structure is tried and tested: humble small-town origins, sweetheart left behind, rigours of boot camp training, horrors of the battlefield. The early scenes hold few surprises as we see loveably gauche Garfield bullied by his drill sergeant (Vince Vaughn) and beaten by fellow-soldiers but refuse to waver from his pacifist beliefs. Once on the Okinawa battlefield, however, Gibson shifts into another gear and proves again that he has few equals in staging armed conflict. This long section is unbearably tense and visceral in every sense, with bodies and souls torn apart as army medic Doss does his duty and far more.

The fact that Doss was a devout Seventh-Day Adventist gives plenty of scope for Gibson to get some sermonising in. He smuggles in too an abusive, alcoholic father (Hugo Weaving) who is eventually redeemed. Gibson has certainly redeemed himself as a director, and even though this film is not in competition, it could be enough to convince Hollywood of a Gibson comeback.

The Distinguished Citizen is one the fest’s best yet. In Mariano Cohn and Gastón Duprat’s bone-dry comedy, a celebrated Argentine novelist living in exile finds out why “go back where you came from” is such a vicious curse. It opens in droll fashion with a bitingly sour Nobel acceptance speech in which Daniel Mantovani (Oscar Martínez) thanks the committee for confirming that he is now officially irrelevant as a writer. In the malaise that follows, all invitations are refused but in a moment of weakness he agrees to return to his home town of Salas.

Once there, Daniel is showered with the milk of human kindness but it doesn’t take long for it to curdle as the unconcealed contempt he has for his origins is turned back on him. It’s a performance of restrained and sustained sardonic brilliance from Martínez in a funny and wise film undermined only by an unnecessary coda.

More male comic despair was to be found in Piuma (Feather), an Italian crowd-pleaser about a young Roman couple’s unplanned pregnancy. The place of this lightweight farce in the Competition raised some eyebrows but it does boast a comedy acting masterclass from permanently exasperated paterfamilias Sergio Pierattini whose wildly semaphoring hand gestures alone were enough to provoke spontaneous rounds of audience applause.

It’s not just the men who are suffering in Venice. Guy de Maupassant’s Une Vie is one of those many 19th-century novels in which a woman is battered and beaten down by life. However, this is not period cinema as we know it. Stéphane Brizé, who won acclaim for The Measure of a Man in Cannes last year, shoots handheld and adopts a modern French idiom that casts off the stiff conventions of costume cinema like an unwanted corset and gives the film a bracing vérité immediacy. Jeanne (Judith Chemla) is shot mostly in tight close-up and conveys movingly the trials of a woman mistreated by her uncaring husband and troublesome son but refuses to relinquish her morals or memories, even the painful ones. It’s an intimate, even suffocating portrayal — not always easy to watch but richly rewarding.

The Bad Batch is not for the faint-hearted either — or the vegetarian. The sophomore feature from Ana Lily Amirpour, whose debut was the hit Farsi vampire flick A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, it stars English model Suki Waterhouse as Arlen, a young woman banished to a lawless ghetto in the Texan desert. Amirpour switches from the sleek black and white of A Girl to an arresting neon-and-dust aesthetic and proves again her command of camera and canny use of music. The first half-hour is A-grade B-movie as Arlen is captured by cannibals and partially devoured before making her escape as meals on wheels via skateboard. Jim Carrey is put to unusual use as a mysterious desert hermit but Keanu Reeves proves an enervating presence as a dozy kingpin. Latterly the film gets lost in its desert milieu but it has all the makings of a cult favourite.

So does Mexico’s The Untamed, in which fantastic realism collides with tentacle erotica. It opens with a jolt. We see a young woman in the final throes of orgasmic pleasure only for the camera to pull back to reveal an eel-like creature slithering away. An incubus? An alien? An ugly metaphor come to life? Director Amat Escalante ( Heli) isn’t telling. Instead he plunges us into a gritty domestic drama in which an end-of-tether mother, her outwardly macho but inwardly conflicted husband and gay brother find themselves sucked into an ever worsening spiral of recrimination and violence. And, now and then, someone disappears to a cabin in the woods to commune with the tentacled creature, culminating in an eye-popping scene that’s surely inspired by the notorious 1814 Japanese woodcut “The Dream of the Fisherman’s Wife”. But the film as a whole is a unique specimen, destined for a following among lovers of the bizarre.

Spira Mirabilis is a feast of visual non-sequiturs and patience-testing sequences in which at one point we’re required literally to watch plaster dry. This meandering non-fiction tone poem takes in the clanging construction of Hang percussion instruments, long shots of embryonic marine life and archive footage of the Native American uprising at Wounded Knee. Halfway through the late screening people were leaving in droves. Only after 90 long minutes does the film start to coalesce into a semi-coherent whole; there’s even humour in the form of a Japanese jellyfish expert and karaoke hobbyist who combines his twin passions in a show-stopping musical turn.

Terrence Malick is still a name to conjure with but increasingly also one to avoid, except for those with a high-tolerance for woolly spirituality and bottomless self-indulgence. Voyage of Time: Life’s Journey attempts to tell the history of the universe in a mercifully brief 90 minutes. As ever, the images are pretty, with clouds scudding and heavenly bodies twinkling like a big-budget computer screensaver. Meanwhile Cate Blanchett dreamily intones what sounds like a prayer: “Oh mother. Who are you? Life-giver, light-bringer.” By the fifth “Oh mother” you start to think “Oh brother”. And by the time the CGI dinosaur from The Tree of Life turns up, it starts to feel like the next ice age is long overdue.

As the festival enters its final phase it’s still all to play for in the hunt for the coveted Golden Lion. Polls of public and critics put Tom Ford’s knockout Nocturnal Animals rightly in the lead, with La La Land and The Distinguished Citizen in hot pursuit. But there are still films to come from big-hitters of world cinema: Andrei Konchalovsky, Lav Diaz and Emir Kusturica. Tune in online on Monday to find out who came out on top."
M0aef3,07/10/2019,mainstream,"By 2050, plastic-eating drones the size of ships will roam the oceans autonomously, collecting debris in much the same way that the Roomba, a vacuum cleaner robot, sucks up dog hair in a living room.

This distant reality is already taking shape. The Ocean Cleanup, a small Dutch start-up that aims to rid the world’s oceans of plastic, recently completed a six-week test that used a giant parachute to collect waste from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — an 80,000-tonne area of plastic that is three times the size of France.

The risk of such a vision, however, is that consumers will depend on technology to save the planet when the more obvious answer is to consume less and reuse more.

“The real solution to this lies on land not in the ocean,” says George Leonard, chief scientist at the Ocean Conservancy, a Washington-based environmental group.

The organisation estimates that 8m tonnes of plastic flow from land into the ocean every year. That is equivalent to one New York City garbage truck full of plastic dumping its contents into the ocean every minute, for a year.

Moreover, this ocean waste cannot be recycled. “The plastic they have collected is not being miraculously turned back into usable products. Most of it is degraded and broken down. You can’t do much with it: you’re either burying it in landfill or burning it,” says Mr Leonard.

With such stark statistics, our environmental trajectory looks unlikely to take us to an idyllic state by 2050. But that could change as consumers and businesses become keen to take action.

“The chances of governments, academia and the private sector doing something about it [recycling] has gone way up in the past two years,” says Dan Helfrich, chief executive of Deloitte Consulting. “That gives me confidence. The conversation has gone from narrow activist to mainstream importance, and when [that happens] the rhetoric slows and the action accelerates.”

One of the most popular consumer items ever — the iPhone — is an example of how business is responding to the call.

The “biggest improvement” Apple has made to the smartphone since 2007 is not the quality of the camera, speed of the processor or any other feature. Instead, it is the “material reuse and closed-loop manufacturing, which was not something that even the genius engineers who innovated the first iPhone would have thought of,” Lisa Jackson, vice-president of environment and social initiatives at Apple, tells the Financial Times.

Closed-loop manufacturing, in which industry repeatedly re-uses materials to conserve resources and lower its carbon footprint, is gaining momentum. By 2050, a “circular economy” — in which products and materials are reused rather than thrown away — could be so normal that making consumer electronics will not require any mining.

Last year Apple unveiled Daisy, a robot that can break down 200 iPhones an hour for their components to be recovered and reused. In the iPhone 11, Apple used recycled rare earth elements — a group of 17 metals widely used in electronics but whose mining and processing is particularly carbon-intensive — to build its Taptic Engine, which enables the device’s screen to mimic the push of a button.

Recycling rare earth elements in high-end consumer products had been dismissed as unrealistic just a few years earlier. “It was classic Apple,” says Ms Jackson, the former head of the US Environmental Protection Agency. “Our people get excited when we’re told something isn’t possible.”

By 2050, further advances in recycling should make it possible for computers to be made entirely from recycled parts — including microchips which require a demanding level of purity, says David Lear, Dell’s vice-president of sustainability.

“We are designing our products knowing we will get them back someday,” he says. “And I’m going to be able to pull materials from other industries, too . . . So we don’t need to dig any more holes or process any more fossil fuels or plastics, metals or aluminium.”

Dell is already making progress, albeit on a small scale. Last year the Texas-based PC and software group partnered with entrepreneurs in India to begin making “pollution ink” by capturing diesel exhaust fumes from generators — one of the largest pollutants in the country. This was then turned into ink for its packaging.

For many brands, creating a more sustainable supply chain may be more expensive.

At present, for example, businesses can save money by using less expensive plastic bags. These, however, are only cheaper because no one is paying the end-of-life costs, says venture capitalist Daniel Oros. The plastic bag often ends up in the ocean — creating an infinitely more expensive problem.

Business incentives could change if consumers stop thinking in terms of cost in the most narrow sense and instead consider sustainable solutions, says Brenda Haitema Arjona, head of Asia at First Mile, a start-up that collects plastics from poor communities and turns them into materials for high-end goods.

“This is the only way forward,” she says. “People must be willing to spend a little bit more on something because it’s been recycled or because they know it has replaceable parts.”"
M14a97,17/06/2020,mainstream,"Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story

Serbia could be one of the few countries in Europe to escape an outright recession in 2020, forecasts President Aleksandar Vucic. This he attributes to the country having contained coronavirus with a severe but relatively brief lockdown.

Mr Vucic says he expects Serbia to eke out an economic expansion of 0.5 to 1 per cent this year. Most other European countries are in the throes of the worst decline since the second world war.

“It’s going to be tougher, it’s going to be harder,” says the president. “But anyway, I think that we will make it better than most of the others.” In other forecasts for Serbia, however, the EBRD and the IMF anticipate contractions of 3.5 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.

Mr Vucic views his record on the economy and public finances as a trump card for his centre-right SNS party with parliamentary elections due on June 21, delayed from April by Covid-19. The SNS is expected to tighten its grip in parliament given that some opposition parties are boycotting the poll.

As president, Mr Vucic has limited formal powers. But he towers over Serbian politics and brooks little dissent, much like his fellow authoritarian democrat in the region, Hungary’s Viktor Orban.

Mr Vucic says the economy will be cushioned by public investment and emergency payments to Serbian households this year. But public sector debt as a proportion of GDP will “never, ever go above 60 per cent”, he insists.

Serbia has become increasingly anchored in European manufacturing supply chains and receives the lion’s share of foreign direct investment in the western Balkans. Its cheap but skilled labour is attractive to foreign business.

Serbia recorded GDP growth of 4.2 per cent last year and 4.4 per cent in 2018. It has a lively IT sector. But unemployment — more than 10 per cent before the pandemic — is high, despite the fact that its population of 7m, is shrinking as a result of a low birth rate and high migration. The economy is marred by poverty and corruption.

Mr Vucic, who was prime minister for three years before winning the presidency in 2017, is a former hardline nationalist who moderated his stance to support EU membership for Serbia.

But he has struck an often ambivalent and sometimes hostile attitude to the union.

In March, after Brussels instigated a permit regime for exports of medical equipment, he lashed out at the EU. Its sense of solidarity did not exist and was a “fairytale”, he said. The EU has given more than €3.6bn of aid to Serbia in the past two decades. This includes €200m in medical and economic assistance to help counter the pandemic.

Mr Vucic vigorously defends his position. “Someone was excluding Serbia and some western Balkan countries from the possibility of getting very important medical equipment for our people,” he says, “we felt left alone.”

Mr Vucic, meanwhile, has lavished praise on China, which he has courted in recent years. Chinese companies have invested in Serbia’s steel, mining and infrastructure. Huawei, which has been awarded a 5G contract, installed mass surveillance equipment in Belgrade.

He has sought to use relations with China, some observers suggest, to gain positive EU attention. Germany is impatient with his inability to deliver a deal on Kosovo, the majority Albanian former Serbian province which declared independence in 2008.

“Even if his statement about EU solidarity was an emotional outburst, it is to some degree what has been going on for a long time in Serbia,” says Florian Bieber, director of the centre for south-east European studies at Graz university in Austria. Mr Vucic “has not been building support” in Serbia for integration with the EU, he adds.

Mr Vucic argues that in the wake of the pandemic he had no choice but to turn to China. It sent the medical supplies that Serbia needed, he says, and Chinese medical advisers for example helped to instigate mass testing.

Serbia recorded 250 deaths and 11,896 confirmed cases of Covid-19 by June 8. Most of the infection came from the 400,000 Serbs who returned in March when EU countries went into lockdown.

Mr Vucic promises to stick to the path of EU accession, given Serbia’s growing dependence on European trade.

But negotiations with Brussels have stalled and concerns are growing about democratic backsliding in Serbia and a fraying of the rule of law. For example, Freedom House, the US-based non-profit organisation that monitors political freedom and human rights, said Serbia, Hungary and Montenegro, no longer had a “partially-consolidated democracy”. Instead, these countries now had “governments in transition or hybrid regimes”. In Serbia’s case, it cited years of “abuse of power, and strongman tactics” by Mr Vucic.

The trends are worsening, says Aleksandra Tomanic, executive director of the European Fund for the Balkans foundation in Belgrade. A journalist was arrested during the pandemic for reporting on the seriousness of the situation — the first such case in 20 years. Some government officials, Ms Tomanic adds, had initially made light of Covid-19 as a “silly virus”.

“We will do our best to change ourselves,” says Mr Vucic in response. He pinpoints judicial reform as “of utmost importance not just for the citizens of Serbia but for attracting foreign direct investors”.

Serbia has been responsible for delays and mistakes in meeting conditions for EU membership, he concedes. But he also says the EU is ambivalent about admitting new members. Mr Vucic has been “steadily moving public opinion away from EU integration”, says Mr Bieber, so “he is no longer dependent on it” as his top political priority.

The unresolved status of Kosovo remains a big block to Serbia joining the EU. Despite renewed US and European efforts to spur an agreement, Mr Vucic is gloomy, arguing that a breakthrough requires “that Albanians are not the only side that is going to be content”.

Western diplomats, he adds, are only talking about technicalities, not the substance of a solution.

“Show me your plan, show me your proposal,” he says. “I cannot hear it and I don’t see it. But I’m ready to listen.”"
M1f369,31/07/2010,mainstream,"I have a terrible weakness for taxidermy, and I recently became the proud owner of two stuffed antique tortoises and as such felt I had joined the noble tradition of grande luxe reptile ownership fashionable among a small but select group of belle époque-era aesthetes.

One of the most memorable passages of À Rebours by Huysmans concerns the protagonist having a tortoise covered with gold and studded with gems, better to set off the colours of the carpet it walked upon. What is even more extraordinary is that this fictional example appears to have been modelled on an actual gold-plated pet owned by Robert Montesquieu, the man to whom Proust gave the epithet, The Professor of Beauty.

Nor was Montesquieu alone; D’Annunzio was given a large tortoise by the flamboyant Marchesa Casati. After its death, the shell was gold-plated and the feet and head cast in bronze; thereafter it sat on a carmine satin cushion in the Italian poet’s dining room. I, however, am only a cut-price aesthete and I am wondering whether I can get away with a can of gold spray paint."

M1d041,30/04/2018,mainstream,"30 April 2018: The Financial Times has today launched a new global brand campaign for FT Weekend. The Open Minds campaign, inspired by its colourful and provocative journalism, aims to encourage stronger engagement with FT Weekend by the FT’s core business audience, while attracting new readers to its world-class coverage of arts, culture, ideas and lifestyle.

The campaign, which builds on a 2017 refresh and rebrand of FT Weekend under editor Alec Russell, will have two phases. The first will include out-of-home, digital display, online video and retail elements in high profile locations in London, Hong Kong and New York's Times Square. The second phase, in the summer, will have a major experiential focus, marking a new direction for the Financial Times.

The creative concept and execution of Open Minds have been developed in partnership with The Brooklyn Brothers. The visually striking phase-one adverts were designed by a variety of illustrators and inspired by a range of thought-provoking FT Weekend articles:
• Can we separate the art from the artist? challenges us to think about the character flaws of renowned artists and entertainers;
• Is age a disease we can cure? poses questions about wellbeing and mortality;
• Is mind control the tech industry’s greatest invention? challenges readers to question their relationship with the smartphone.

Financial Times chief communications and marketing officer, Finola McDonnell, said: “We have created this campaign with editorial content at its centre to have strong visual and intellectual impact, sparking debate and conversation - exactly what FT Weekend aims to do. We're positioning the FT Weekend as an essential read for those interested in arts, culture, ideas and lifestyle, just as the Financial Times and ft.com are essential to our core business readership.""

FT Weekend editor Alec Russell said: “This campaign goes to the heart of my ambition for the journalism in FT Weekend each week. It is sharp, provocative, probing and embraces the big ideas of our age - yet it is also tinged with mischief.”

The campaign will be supported by social media activity on the FT’s Facebook, Twitter (@FTWeekend and @FTLifeArts) and Instagram (@FT_Weekend) accounts with the hashtag #FTOpenMinds. The articles which inspired the campaign can all be found outside the FT’s paywall at FT.com/OpenMinds.

M0818d,27/12/2013,mainstream,"Will 2013 go down in art market history as the peak of a boom, or the beginning of a new world order for art sales? After the blockbusting, $691m sale of contemporary art at Christie’s in New York in November, with its record high prices – $142.4m for a Bacon, $58.4m for a Koons – art adviser Abigail Asher declared: “It’s a new world: it feels like a reinvention of the art market. I’m overwhelmed.” Certainly, the prices now fetched in the market for top-level, postwar and contemporary art by both living and dead artists are enormous and inexplicable to many. But according to Christie’s, there were six people bidding more than $100m for the Bacon – two of them Asian. Every one of the top ten in that sale went for more than $20m. That gives an idea of the depth of the market and its geographical spread. As New York dealer Edward Tyler Nahem said: “In sheer defiance of other global economic trends, or perhaps because of such trends, there is an unprecedented flow of money into the art market. For some, this could represent a flight of capital from other conceivably more unstable harbours to comfortably park one’s wealth.”

While it is customary to say that the market’s strength is focused on just a few artists, Art Basel Miami Beach and its attendant fairs, taking place a couple of weeks after the New York sales, saw art selling merrily at every level – from the million-dollar, safe-bet end of Katz, Calder and Koons to emerging artists priced from the low thousands at the satellite fairs. These included a paper construction by Sarah Bridgland at $2,000, digital animations by Yorgo Alexopoulos at $11,000 and a diptych by Hans Kotter at $35,000, all of which found buyers at the Pulse fair.

It seems contradictory that the follow-up to the rip-roaring New York sales was the departure of two major figures from the contemporary art departments of Sotheby’s and Christie’s. The news that Tobias Meyer, chief auctioneer and head of contemporary art at Sotheby’s, had left was shuffled out on a Friday night just before Thanksgiving week. With Sotheby’s under attack from activist shareholders, notably Daniel Loeb – who is also an art collector – all sorts of interpretations were put on his departure, but it does seem to have been by mutual agreement. Then in December Christie’s head honcho for “contemporary art development”, Amy Cappellazzo, also jumped ship. Both Meyer and Cappellazzo say they will be working in private sales, and this makes sense. They know the business through and through, they know “where the bodies are buried” in auction speak, meaning the location of the juiciest works of art, and they hobnob with the top collectors. Instead of drawing a salary, why not earn much more as dealers?

The year also saw Christie’s and Sotheby’s continue their thrusts into new markets. Both have been longing to get into mainland China, and both held sales there. Christie’s rolled out the red carpet for Chinese buyers in September in Shanghai, when it held a small but significant sale of western and Asian art, watches and various sundries, garnering $25m and selling a Picasso for $1.9m. Of the 40 lots on offer, only one failed to sell, but the point of the event – for which Christie’s shipped in all its top brass and a swath of collectors – was to anchor the brand in Chinese minds. Then Sotheby’s held a “Beijing art week”, with an auction and selling show, making $37.3m for a 141-lot auction and setting a new price high for Zao Wou-ki at $14.7m. Finally, Christie’s was gearing up for its first sale in India, with an 83-lot sale in Mumbai, scheduled just before Christmas.

Bad news came this year, however, for collectors who had trusted the Knoedler name and bought multimillion-dollar works from the venerable New York gallery, shuttered in 2011. People such as Tom Ford’s chairman Domenico De Sole, hedge fund manager Pierre Lagrange, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art in Missouri and many others had acquired from the dealer abstract expressionist and modernist works by the likes of Rothko, Kline and Pollock, some for multimillion sums. The person who supplied them to Knoedler, Glafira Rosales, pleaded guilty in September to selling fakes fabricated by a Chinese painter in Queens. Knoedler is closed and Rosales is facing a long prison sentence, so who will compensate buyers – seven are suing – for their now-worthless paintings?

The case was also bad news for art experts, a number of whom had accepted as authentic the works Knoedler was selling. Conclusion: it seems much easier than previously thought to hoodwink specialists of 20th-century works of art. Provenance, now, is going to be far more important. Ideally in the future, a vendor called “Mr X-who-doesn’t-want-to-be-named” will set off all sorts of alarm bells, although I actually doubt the designation will disappear completely. A new art sales site, ArtWise, is apparently going to connect buyers and sellers while each keeps complete anonymity – hardly the more transparent market that many would like to see in the wake of the Rosales scandal.

As for art galleries, 2013 saw further expansion internationally. Paris’s Emmanuel Perrotin opened a New York outlet, adding to an operation that includes Hong Kong and three galleries in Paris. Marian Goodman is opening in London next year: Thaddaeus Ropac will inaugurate a new space in 2014 at an as-yet-undisclosed location – but not in Europe. At the same time, a number of midsized dealers closed, squeezed between the big boys and the smaller, slimmer emerging galleries. D’Amelio Terras in New York, Jérôme de Noirmont in Paris and Martin Klosterfeld in Berlin all closed. And some other Berlin galleries were thought to be in the red.

Deborah Fuller had just heard the sentences that were the closest she would get to justice.

In March 2016, her daughter Sarah died from an overdose of drugs that included Subsys: a tiny yet potent spray containing fentanyl, an opioid 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine. The day before her death, mother and daughter had chatted about her upcoming wedding. Sarah had already bought a garter. Deborah was planning to sew her veil.

The next morning, Sarah’s fiancé found her dead, keeled over on her face. “It was not a vision I would wish on anyone. We had to have her cremated because there was no way they could have made it so that she was recognisable,” Deborah recalls in an interview.

The former nursing assistant had first become addicted to opioids when she was prescribed them for fibromyalgia and neck and back injuries. After she recovered from the addiction, she visited a new doctor. With an Insys sales representative in the room, she was put back on opioids including Subsys — and within 20 days, her dose of the spray was tripled. Admitted to hospital for hyper-sedation, physicians recommended she stop using the spray — but her doctor continued to prescribe it.

Now, four years later, executives from Insys, the maker of Subsys, had become the first pharmaceutical bosses to be handed prison time for their role in America’s opioid epidemic. Clutching her speech, the 62-year-old mother from New Jersey stood outside the court in Boston this January and accused John Kapoor, the Insys founder, and his colleagues of a “greed and fraud” that took Sarah away when she was just 32. “They are no different from mobsters,” she said.

Seven of the Insys executives and employees on trial were found guilty of masterminding and participating in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe the drug. Kapoor was sentenced to five and a half years on charges that included racketeering conspiracy. Michael Babich, Insys’ former chief executive, and Alec Burlakoff, former vice-president of sales, co-operated with prosecutors and received two and a half, and 26 months, respectively.

Fuller calls the sentences “a disgrace”, believing they should have been far longer. But she hopes the sheer fact of people going to prison will deter other drugmakers, which may have previously accepted fines as a cost of doing business. “Normally, they just get a slap on the wrist and have to pay a penalty, which was easily made up by selling more opioids,” she says. “At least now, they’ll have to think, maybe they’ll go to jail for this.”

The opioid epidemic has shaped America. There have been 750,000 overdose deaths since the crisis began in 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and about two-thirds involved an opioid. Fuller’s family is one of many still suffering from losing a loved one.

Many people hooked on illegal opioids start on painkillers prescribed by doctors. At first, marketers convinced some physicians that opioids were not as addictive as previously thought. But in some regions, the abuse became brazen. One town in West Virginia had 3,200 residents, but was receiving enough opioids for them to take 6,500 pills each over 10 years.

In a joint investigation between the FT and the PBS series Frontline, we spoke to several former employees about life inside Insys, including Burlakoff, the former vice-president of sales, who we questioned under prosecutors’ supervision. We also interviewed prosecutors, short sellers and the reporters who exposed the scheme.

Insys was a flagrant flouter of the rules. Founded in 2002, it started clinical trials for its under-the-tongue fentanyl spray in 2007. Subsys won regulatory approval in 2012, more than a decade into the opioid crisis, when overdose deaths were already rising and after other pharma companies had been fined for mismarketing opioids.

The company used tactics familiar in the US pharmaceutical industry — but took them across the line into illegality. Many drugmakers pay speakers’ fees to doctors, with the understanding that they will recommend their product to peers at educational events — but Insys made it clear that they expected more prescriptions in return for their money. Sometimes it abandoned the pretence of such events completely.

Subsys was approved for “breakthrough” bursts of pain in cancer patients already tolerant to opioids, yet the majority of prescriptions were for patients, like Fuller, who did not even have cancer. It is legal and common for doctors in the US to prescribe drugs “off label” or for uses they are not approved for. But it is illegal for pharmaceutical companies to market their medicines for these other uses.

Jerry Avorn, who heads the division of pharmacoepidemiology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, believes it was mostly the marketing to doctors that made Subsys “lethal”. “The Insys example is the extreme . . . ‘mass shooter’ version of what happens when you create a culture that does not pay enough attention to what’s true and what isn’t about drugs, and where you allow uncontrolled marketing,” he says. “What made it so dangerous was people getting behind it and seeing it as a ticket to riches.”

The pharmaceutical industry has a history of paying settlements in the billions of dollars. But even as evidence of investigations began to emerge, analysts played down the risks, sometimes citing companies that had previously only received fines, and investors bid up the stock.

estimated cost to the US of the opioid epidemic between 2015 and 2018

Across the US, counties and states are now suing pharmaceutical companies, desperate to recoup the cost of treating and policing those hooked on their drugs. Many of the defendants have teamed up to offer $48bn to settle these suits — but so far, many states are holding out for more. After all, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, the crisis cost the country $2.5tn from 2015 to 2018.

“Most people involved in making opioids, distributing them and financing the companies turned a blind eye as at first there were thousands of deaths, then tens of thousands, and then hundreds of thousands of deaths. These are the kind of numbers we usually associate with genocides and civil wars — in the richest country in the history of human civilisation,” says Anand Giridharadas, author of Winners Take All, a critique of how elites make their money. “There’s now a mountain of evidence about all the people who had warning signs who ignored them.”

At the end of 2013, Insys chief executive Michael Babich was lauded on CNBC. The stock was the best performing initial public offering of the year — up by more than 400 per cent at its peak — and sales had risen almost sevenfold year-on-year. The TV anchor served up a softball: “Tell us what it is about Insys that has investors so excited?”

Wearing a tightly buttoned gingham shirt, Babich showed off the Subsys spray, smaller than an asthma inhaler. He blinked rapidly as he trotted out the official line: the product is designed for cancer patients suffering from “breakthrough” bursts of pain.

Wall Street was captivated by the numbers coming out of the small Arizona-based company — and downplayed risks it could not quantify. The Wall Street Journal praised Babich that year as “the right kind of insider trader” for legally buying more stock to show his conviction in Insys. Insys founder, John Kapoor, originally from India, cast himself as an immigrant success story, telling Forbes: “This is the country you can do it in. Nowhere else.”

David Amsellem, a softly spoken analyst at Piper Sandler with decades of experience covering pharmaceuticals, recommended buying Insys in 2014. Speaking in a conference room above New York’s Park Avenue, he described how he and fellow analysts were impressed that sales were taking off, when most small biotech companies spend years investing in R&D before selling anything. “Insys was a rare breed as a company that had a product that was on the market,” he says. “In other words, it wasn’t just a hope and a dream.”

For Stephanie Yon, however, Insys was a nightmare. That December when Babich was promoting the fentanyl spray on TV, the Michigan mother of three started seeing Dr Gavin Awerbuch, seeking treatment for pain from a car crash the month before. Yon did not have cancer. She had not taken opioids before. Subsys came with a “black-box warning” that it could cause respiratory depression and death. Yet Awerbuch prescribed her a plethora of opioids, including Subsys. Then, he increased her dose rapidly. The 38-year-old died on March 14 2014, just three months after the initial prescription, with lethal levels of fentanyl in her body.

Brian McKeen, the lawyer for Yon’s family, says no one could have mistaken the drug as safe. “It doesn’t happen because of a lack of scientific knowledge, or a lack of warning. It happens because of doctors disregarding patient safety and putting their own financial interest first,” he says.

Unbeknown to Yon, her doctor had such a close relationship to Insys that the company’s management would advise sales reps across the US to get their own Awerbuch. He was the top prescriber of Subsys in the country, helping fuel sales that rose 276 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2014. In return, his pockets jangled with so-called “speakers’ fees”: in 18 months, he was paid $138,000, ostensibly for educating other medical professionals about the drug. The local press reported that much was spent on his vast collection of ancient coins.

At the trial last year, Awerbuch described searching his files for new patients to write Subsys prescriptions for. “It got to the point — and this was a complete lack of judgment on my part, but I started prescribing Subsys to patients who really didn’t need such a potent medicine,” he said. “I probably went against my Hippocratic oath and did prescribe medicine that could potentially harm patients.”

He liked the money and the Insys reps, who made him feel like they were his friends. Many were hired for their beauty — Burlakoff says he knew that “sex sells” — and few had deep experience in pharmaceuticals. “Honestly, they had beautiful sales reps, and I liked the attention I was getting,” Awerbuch testified. Two months after Yon died, he was arrested. He pled guilty and was sentenced to 32 months in prison and forced to pay restitution and fines of $4.1m.

“When you have a prescriber who can say, ‘I was bribed,’ that’s an important moment,” says Nat Yeager, who prosecuted the Insys executives. But inside the company, Burlakoff claims, no one cared. In fact, the sales representative who courted Awerbuch was promoted. Asked about the case on an earnings call, Babich insisted: “In no way, shape or form was there any allegations against Insys” [sic].

Amsellem, the Piper Sandler analyst, says Insys leaders were “very, very clear” that the doctors who were arrested were just “bad actors”. “Basically, I had to take management’s word for it. And there’s always going to be that element of trust,” he says. “You want to believe that management teams are going to be honest.”

Giridharadas says Wall Street funded the opioid crisis, just like it speculated its way into causing the financial crisis. “The system is set up to tell corporations to make as much money as possible by cutting every possible societal corner,” he says. “It is a sector of our society that is consistently working and advocating against the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness of the American people.”

A year later, Insys sales representatives were revelling in their success. Sales in the first quarter of 2015 soared more than 70 per cent year-on-year, and the stock was climbing towards its peak that July, at almost six times the IPO price. At a national sales conference in Arizona, reps showed off a video that was later to become an exhibit at trial. Parodying a hit by hip-hop artist A$AP Rocky, the sales reps rapped: “I love titration. Yeah, that’s not a problem. I got new patients, and I got a lot of ’em.”

The lines referred to the tactics used by sales reps of pressuring doctors to escalate patient doses of Subsys — known as titration. Higher doses fetched higher prices, and so the reps pocketed fatter commissions. In the video, a man in a giant Subsys costume dances with the rappers. At the end, Burlakoff comes out from under the costume. The audience laughed and clapped, one former sales representative told the FT and PBS Frontline. They had no idea that it would be “a piece of evidence in court in four or five years’ time,” he says.

Our team interviewed Burlakoff last summer, before he was sentenced, under the supervision of the prosecutors at a studio in Boston. Wearing the smart suit of the salesman he once was, he was extremely talkative. Just as he had decided to “co-operate like nobody’s business” with the prosecutors, he was eager to recount how Insys devised its scheme. “I didn’t think about the patients, the people suffering, the addiction,” he admits. “I imagined that I was selling a widget.”

He described how he was in awe of the billionaire Kapoor and set about creating a team that would recruit doctors who, nine times out of 10, were not oncologists. “It all comes down to targeting. You gotta find their hot button. Whatever makes them tick. And it sounds ruthless and it is ruthless that we would target someone that is in distress in an effort to take advantage of them,” he says. Sometimes the target was wooed more literally. “Sex with a doctor or chartering a private jet and taking a couple of doctors to, say, Cancún, Mexico. It’s been done,” he says.

The criminal conspiracy went right to the top. While many pharmaceutical companies pay speakers’ fees to doctors, they don’t officially expect them to prescribe more of their drug. Kapoor insisted on a clear return on investment. “Dr Kapoor doesn’t lose. He made that very clear. He did not want to lose a penny,” Burlakoff recalls. Insys sales representatives were instructed to deliver at least a 2:1 return. “The only way that I knew how to do it, to get that guarantee, is to bribe doctors.”

This clarity was to prove the company’s downfall. Prosecutors discovered a spreadsheet — which they dubbed a “smoking gun” — that showed calculations of the return Insys was getting from its investment in speakers’ fees. Insys also deceived insurers so they would pay for prescriptions. The company created an internal reimbursement centre, giving staff carefully worded scripts known as “The Spiel” that would convince insurers to pay up, often by implying — or even claiming — that a patient had cancer when they did not.

Fred Wyshak, one of the prosecutors, said in an interview: “Kapoor decided that, ‘If I’m paying doctors to speak, I’m also paying them to write [prescriptions].’ And philosophically, that’s not supposed to be the way it works. I’m not saying that’s not the reality in the pharmaceutical industry, and as I think Burlakoff described it, that’s the dirty little secret in the pharmaceutical industry, but nobody ever discusses it.”

Wyshak had built his career prosecuting the mafia. He used similar tactics to turn witnesses and unearth evidence to prosecute Insys leadership. Kapoor was the ultimate target. “The executives at Insys displayed an arrogance that you find in organised crime groups,” he says. “They thought that they were above the law.”

Short sellers, who search for stocks they think will fall and profit if they do, were also digging into Insys. They believed that Wall Street was missing warning signs. Jim Carruthers, who runs his firm Sophos Capital from Silicon Valley, became suspicious because there were so few doctors prescribing so much Subsys. Carruthers had shorted healthcare companies before and began to piece together public data including which doctors Insys was paying, available under transparency laws, and the numbers of overdoses related to the drug. He also hired a private investigator, who visited a top prescriber in Alabama, describing it as the “epitome of a pill mill”.

“We thought this was all information that when it came out into the public market, that would change the investors’ perception of the value of the stock,” Carruthers says. His “aha moment” came when his firm approached someone who used to work for Insys competitor Cephalon. It turned out the employee also used to work for Insys. “When we asked him why he left that name off his résumé he told us, ‘Because these guys are all going to get arrested. They’re all going to go to prison,’” he says.

Carruthers built his short position and sent tips to journalists. In April 2015, Roddy Boyd, a hedge-fund analyst-turned-investigative reporter in North Carolina, published an exposé, “Insys Therapeutics and the New ‘Killing It’” on his non-profit site, called The Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation at the time. The stock fell almost 10 per cent. Within weeks, though, it had recovered. Carruthers says the “greed” went beyond the top of Insys, down to its investors. “There were people on Wall Street who were intent on keeping this stock price up and, I believe, ignoring some of the more obvious indications that this was an unsustainable, potentially fraudulent business model,” he says.

Amsellem says the first reports of investigations into Insys were met with a “collective shrug”. “There had been a whole host of investigations of other companies, companies that are industry leaders and big fines that were paid. And none of these companies were put into bankruptcy,” he says.

When David Steinberg, an analyst at Jefferies, initiated coverage of the stock as a “buy” in late 2014, he acknowledged the investigations could bring “more negative headlines”. “As we are not privy to the facts, we are not in a position to render a conclusion. That said, we’re pretty sure that the worst case outcome for Insys is some sort of fine,” he wrote. The fact that investors assumed investigations could be settled for a fine was understandable. There was no precedent for pharmaceutical executives being sent to jail. Purdue Pharma, owned by certain members of the Sackler family, had settled a 2007 misbranding case of its opioid OxyContin for $600m. Cephalon, which also sold a fast-acting fentanyl product Actiq and had previously employed Burlakoff, settled investigations into its marketing practices in 2008 for $425m.

“If Cephalon executives had gone to jail for the way they promoted Actiq, for actions they took that promoted a loss of life, then maybe we wouldn’t have had a Subsys,” says Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management.

In late 2015, more heavy prescribers of Subsys were arrested and the company began to suspect federal agents were pursuing executives. And yet, in 2016, five out of the six analysts covering the stock still had “buy” or “outperform” ratings on it. Some analysts kept buy ratings on Insys until shortly before it went bankrupt in 2019, according to Sinan Gokkaya, an associate professor of finance at Ohio University. “Short sellers have an incentive to push down the price so they can get involved in negative investigations,” he says. “If I’m an analyst, I don’t have much to gain from a negative stock price.”

In May 2017, Amsellem became the second to downgrade Insys, rating it “neutral”. He did not rate it as “underweight” until March 2018, five months after Kapoor had been arrested and charged. Amsellem says he wanted to keep his focus on “data and information”. By 2018, investigations had made doctors more cautious about prescribing any fast-acting fentanyl drug. Subsys sales were lower than they had been at the initial public offering in 2013.

“I don’t regret not downgrading it earlier,” he explains. “I think that to make decisions on stocks you have to be methodical . . . You don’t want to be knee-jerk. Does that mean that sometimes you might get things wrong? Yes. I get things wrong all the time in terms of stockpicking.”

If you google “Subsys”, you will find, perhaps surprisingly, that the tiny fentanyl spray is still on the market in the US. After executives were convicted and Insys was ordered to pay $225m to the US government, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2019. Subsys was sold to Wyoming-based BTcP Pharma, in return for paying a proportion of sales to creditors. Several state attorney-generals objected. The Maryland attorney-general argued there were “ample red flags” about the new owner. “Patients became addicted to Subsys through Insys’ misconduct and their addiction has not been treated; the court should ensure, in approving any sale, that Subsys will not fall into the hands of those who would further exploit that addiction through intentional conduct or negligence,” the objection read. “Further harm should not emerge from this bankruptcy.” The sale was approved after BTcP promised to only market it for cancer patients. BTcP’s parent company did not respond to a request for comment.

Insys was an extraordinary case of explicit bribery to prescribe a potent opioid — and an unusual example of government agencies rallying together to prosecute executives. But it also exposed flaws in how the US regulates drugs. The system makes it hard to catch bad actors — whether individuals or entire companies — before they devastate lives.

Chris McGreal, author of American Overdose, says it took the FDA 20 years to improve its monitoring of whether a drug is addictive. “One of the strongest and most constant criticisms of the FDA during this epidemic is that it’s taken a very narrow view of the grounds on which it approves a drug,” he explains. “They don’t want to know the answer to the question, is this drug addictive and therefore dangerous? Will it kill patients?”

Since Subsys came on the market in 2012, the regulator has put new warnings on the boxes of opioids and required companies to do studies into misuse and overdose after approval. It has requested that one opioid — Opana ER, made by Endo Pharmaceuticals — be removed from the market because of patterns of abuse, but also approved Dsuvia, by AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, another fast-acting opioid, despite strong criticism.

Yet off-label prescription is still rife. Sometimes it makes sense to give doctors discretion, but it can also be dangerous: concerns have been raised about the effects of anti-psychotics prescribed for dementia, which ended up increasing death rates, and antidepressants that raise the risk of suicide in children and adolescents.

Aaron Kesselheim, a professor at Harvard Medical School, believes the FDA needs to invest more in monitoring drugs after they have approved them. He fears recent court cases have given pharma companies more — not less — latitude in how they market drugs off-label. “Things are moving in the wrong direction,” he says.

The Physician Payment Sunshine Act of 2010 put data on doctors taking dollars online. But it would take an enterprising patient to discover it — and decipher what it might mean for their care. And transparency has not stopped many doctors from taking the money. A 2019 paper in the journal Addiction analysed data from more than 800,000 physicians and found those who received money from opioid makers tend to prescribe substantially larger quantities of opioids.

The US is now consumed by another public health disaster. Yet the coronavirus pandemic could end up exacerbating the opioid epidemic. A report from the Well Being Trust, a foundation focused on mental health, predicted “deaths of despair” from suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, could rise because of Covid-19, leading to another 75,000 deaths. Lawsuits against other opioid makers have been delayed by lockdowns. There are civil suits against much larger companies including Johnson & Johnson and Teva, as well as distributors and pharmacies. Attorney-generals are pursuing certain members of the Sackler family in relation to Purdue Pharma, but those cases are on hold as part of the bankruptcy process. There are also signs of a criminal investigation, with opioid manufacturers being hit with subpoenas. The companies and members of the Sackler family all deny any wrongdoing.

Wall Street analysts do now say that litigation risks are affecting their ratings. But they still view the potential fines as a financial calculation. As news has trickled out about possible settlements, they have tried to look for bright sides. One wrote that the deal would likely be less than the $248bn the tobacco industry settled for in 1998, because there have been fewer deaths from prescription opioids than there were from smoking. Another called possible fines “manageable” for J&J, which is the world’s largest healthcare company.

Meanwhile families such as the Fullers live with their loss every day. Deborah says the end of the year is always a slog: Sarah is missing from Thanksgiving, then her birthday, then Christmas. “We haven’t decorated for Christmas in some time,” she says. “Within a very short period of time, there are all these family-oriented holidays, when one fourth of our family is not here any more.” She hopes the Insys case will be a warning to other drugmakers — but she also believes the broader system needs to change. It should be far harder to prescribe medications off-label, especially dangerous opioids, she says. Doctors should be cautious about taking money from pharmaceutical companies, and, if they do, they should be forced to declare it “in a frame in big letters in their office”.

“They take an oath not to hurt anybody,” she says. “When your patients are dying . . . that goes beyond hurting.”

US pharmaceutical executives have been put on notice that they could be held criminally liable for fuelling America’s epidemic of opioid addiction, after the founder of the drugmaker Insys was sentenced on Thursday to five-and-a-half years in prison for masterminding a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe a dangerous painkiller.

Using laws designed to catch mob bosses, prosecutors secured the conviction of John Kapoor and six other Insys executives and employees last year on charges including racketeering conspiracy. The company funnelled money to doctors to boost sales of Subsys, a painkilling spray containing fentanyl, an opioid 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin.

Earlier in the day, Alec Burlakoff, Insys’s former head of sales, received a 26-month sentence for the same charges. Michael Babich, the former chief executive, has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years.

The prison terms have been handed down as other opioid makers and distributors are being criminally investigated and prosecutors are aiming to hold executives accountable in a pharma industry that has frequently dismissed fines as a cost of doing business.

As part of a joint investigation between the Financial Times and the PBS series Frontline, Mr Burlakoff spoke to journalists under the supervision of federal prosecutors in Boston. The interview took place last year, on the condition that it was only published after sentencing.

Acknowledging that he did not have “morals, ethics and values” and that he did his job knowing the scheme orchestrated with Mr Kapoor was illegal, Mr Burlakoff said he still had “no idea that criminally there would be consequences . . . I don’t want to go to jail. Who wants to go to jail?”

He described his thinking: “Not only is the company going to get fined an astronomical amount of money, which I’ve seen a million times, but worse case scenario, which I’ve never seen before, they might actually take my money.”

Subsys was approved for cancer patients already taking opioids who were experiencing the sharp pangs of what is called breakthrough pain. But the vast majority of doctors Insys targeted were not oncologists.

Mr Burlakoff said that no one at the company cared whether the doctors were prescribing it “on-label” for cancer patients or “off-label” for anyone else. If Insys had just stuck to cancer patients, he said, “you never would have heard of the company”.

Mr Kapoor, now 76, is a serial pharma entrepreneur who emigrated to the US from India in his early 20s. He founded Insys in 1990, and the company received regulatory approval for its fentanyl spray in 2012. Since then, hundreds of deaths have been linked to the drug.

As the US reels from an opioid crisis that has turned 2m Americans into addicts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Insys and Purdue Pharma — a company owned by members of the billionaire Sackler family, which makes OxyContin — have both gone bankrupt under the weight of legal liabilities. Other opioid makers and distributors are trying to negotiate a settlement deal with state and local governments.

Speaker programmes sponsored by drug companies are common practice, paying doctors to educate their peers, but Mr Burlakoff described how Insys went far beyond what was legal to create a quid pro quo with those who prescribed its painkiller. Some 13 medical professionals have already been charged and some have served jail time.

Under the scheme, doctors could earn up to $125,000 a year in “honorariums” for speaking about the drug at events that were often simply dinners with sales reps and the prescriber’s own friends — or that sometimes did not happen at all. At the executives’ trial in Boston in the spring of 2019, prosecutors presented a spreadsheet Insys used to show the return on investment of speakers’ payments.

Mr Kapoor insisted on receiving a minimum two dollars of revenue from the drug for every dollar it spent on doctors, according to Mr Burlakoff.

“He insisted on being able to draw a direct correlation between the dollars we pay the speaker and the number of dollars we received back via prescriptions that they prescribed,” Mr Burlakoff said.

Mr Kapoor’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. In a court filing, they argued their client was portrayed as a “caricature” of a mob boss, rather than an “immigrant success story” who developed the drug after seeing his wife die from cancer.

The court heard how Insys sales representatives also pushed doctors to increase patients’ dose of Subsys, a medical practice known as titration, because higher doses generated more revenue. Prosecutors said that it was tantamount to bribing doctors to overdose their patients.

The callous culture was demonstrated by an internal video played to the jury, in which Insys sales reps perform a rap about the drug while a man dressed as a giant Subsys bottle dances around. “I love titration, yeah, it’s not a problem,” they rap. “I got new patients and I got a lot of them.”

At the end, it is revealed that Mr Burlakoff is inside the costume — though he claimed he was not wearing it for the entire video.

“I realise how gross and disgusting and offensive it is now, but I was just so impressed with the work and the money and the detail that they put into it, I was like, emotional,” he said.

Mr Burlakoff said at first he admired the video but now views appearing in it as one of his biggest mistakes.

“I showed it to my wife and my kids and they enjoyed it. They didn’t know anything about Subsys or titration and that patients were actually dying as a result of it.”

While pharmaceutical companies are frequently fined by regulators, it is rare for executives to go to jail. In all, seven Insys executives and employees were found guilty of racketeering conspiracy, an offence introduced in the 1970s to pursue organised crime, as well as charges of wire fraud conspiracy and mail fraud conspiracy. As well as Mr Kapoor, Mr Babich and Mr Burlakoff, they include Richard Simon, national director of sales, and Michael Gurry, who oversaw the unit responsible for getting reimbursements from insurers. Both received sentences of 33 months. Two regional sales managers were also convicted.

Convictions for honest services fraud and violations of the Controlled Substances act were overruled by the judge in November.

The use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act placed criminal liability for misdeeds on the people at the top of outfits such as the mafia and, more recently, other organisations, including in the Fifa football corruption case in 2015, where several officials pleaded guilty to the charge.

While criminal cases against corporate leaders are still very rare, there has been a rapid expansion in civil suits attempting to use the statute; it is one of the charges in a case against other opioid makers and distributors.

Jeff Grell, a lawyer from Grell Feist, said that in “a normal criminal case, you essentially have to have blood on your hands, pulling the trigger, robbing the money, selling the drugs. Under Rico, that’s not necessary. Rico seeks to impose liability on persons who are knowingly operating and managing the people who are directly committing a crime.”

Fred Wyshak, one of the federal prosecutors who led the Insys case, began his career prosecuting a mob family he compared to the Sopranos, and he later helped convict James “Whitey” Bulger, an Irish-American organised crime boss in the Boston area, of being complicit in 11 murders. He said he hoped the Insys convictions would encourage other prosecutors to consider similar cases.

“If you’re in business and you can make billions of dollars and then pay a fine [of] maybe a fraction of that, you’re earning a profit by engaging in criminal activity,” Mr Wyshak said.

Nathaniel Yeager, head of the Massachusetts healthcare fraud unit, added that the convictions should send a message to drug industry executives that “their conduct is going to be treated just like any other criminal conduct”.

Since making his deal to assist federal prosecutors, Mr Burlakoff said, he had been trying to take responsibility for his actions — but he insisted Insys was not alone in the pharma industry.

“The reality of the matter is, I made terrible mistakes, I’m in trouble for it, I’m paying the price,” he said. “Are there other people doing the exact same thing I’m doing, right now? Absolutely.”

M1f223,11/05/2020,mainstream,"As the coronavirus took hold in the Chinese city of Wuhan, officials at the Asian Development Bank received a call from China Gas, a longstanding private sector client of the Manila-based backer.

“We were asked whether the ADB could help China Gas finance liquefied natural gas for new hospitals that were hastily being constructed to meet the growing demand for beds,” says Michael Barrow, head of lending in the private-sector division. “We now have to prioritise Covid-immediate responses.”

The pandemic means this is not the time for “business as usual”. Infrastructure plans are being put on hold, whether by the private sector and governments or development banks such as the ADB and the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which in more normal times make possible many of the most ambitious cross-border projects.

The outbreak has prompted fears that vital work will be postponed indefinitely as money goes to dealing with more immediate threats. The ADB has just tripled to $20bn its spending to help governments deal with the consequences of the virus.

Recent progress in ensuring that infrastructure is green, sustainable and resilient may be suspended as governments back away from commitments to deal with longer-term threats such as climate change and rising sea levels.

The blue skies that have returned to the region — replacing the yellow and grey as industry grinds to a halt and the roads empty of vehicles spewing toxic fumes — may even remove the sense of urgency in dealing with pollution. If oil is at $20 a barrel, the need to switch to renewables may seem less pressing.

Still, regional development banks now have a critical role in helping to steer a course between the immediate threat of Covid-19 and the long-term need for infrastructure to support growth. Often, they have more credibility than governments, especially in the eyes of the private sector.

Individual governments in emerging Asia often need help with both planning and financing the infrastructure projects that — if done right — are the key to prosperity. They include roads so farmers can get produce to markets and children can attend school, or power plants so countries can attract manufacturing industry and jobs. But few governments, whether in developing or developed nations, do a good job with this.

Politicians tend to think in terms of election cycles, which can be as short as two years. Infrastructure, on the other hand, is all about spending money today for a benefit that will become apparent years later.

Meanwhile, when setting returns, the private sector considers governments as among the biggest risk factors, whether for obtaining land or permits. If the government changes, policies often change too, and support fades away leaving private companies stranded.

One consequence of the pandemic, particularly the threat to employment, is awareness of the potential for a breakdown in social cohesion. The response is likely to involve developments such as focusing on food security for the poor in the short term and ensuring that social safety nets are stronger in the longer term.

“Social transfers are critical,” says Ramesh Subramaniam, head of south-east Asia for the Asian Development Bank, adding that companies have only a small supporting role in such programmes.

Once the immediate threat from the Covid-19 pandemic passes, climate change could force all constituencies to think about infrastructure in new ways — including focusing on green, sustainable and resilient ventures. In other words, infrastructure investment and ESG investing are likely to converge. That already resonates with some parts of the private sector, which is under increasing pressure globally to comply with best standards.

These days, private institutions such as BlackRock and other asset managers, along with banks and insurers, are taking the lead in boycotting formerly standard infrastructure projects, such as building thermal coal plants.

Insurers such as Swiss Re increasingly consider climate change in their calculations because they insure against events such as extreme weather, which has increased in both frequency and severity because of climate change. Swiss Re, like other insurers, says that it sees the need for sustainable, resilient infrastructure as a kind of risk management.

The most sustainable infrastructure projects now are in new initiatives, such as affordable housing, that have both an immediate social and economic effect and can attract the private sector too.

Affordable housing has become a priority for development banks in the region. The International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, is working with a Swiss company to build such housing in Vietnam — a project called EZ Land — and with Ciputra, a local property developer, on the outskirts of Jakarta, Indonesia.

Vivek Pathak is in charge of East Asia for the IFC arm of the World Bank Group. He says that when he was coaxing private sector companies to build housing for a price that allowed them to make a profit while also adopting the best green standards, he found the most persuasive argument was to ask which sort of housing was likely to hold its value — green or brown.

“It has to make business sense. It can’t just be about corporate social responsibility,” he says."
M1f422,19/01/2018,mainstream,"The US president’s announcement that he would address the March for Life anti-abortion rally on Friday was not only a renunciation of his past “pro-choice” views. It also marks a further trumping of high-level policy by personal belief or political expediency at the expense of evidence — and with global implications.

Domestically, the White House is planning new “conscience” protections for health workers who do not want to perform abortions or other procedures where they have moral objections. A report from Planned Parenthood is highly critical of recent decisions on birth control, STI/HIV services and cancer screenings as well as the “global gag” rule, limiting foreign aid for services offering abortion and hitting countries like Uganda hard.

Yet there are alternative voices — from this weekend's Women’s March to the She Decides movement — more focused on evidence. Unesco recently updated its International Guidance on Sexuality Education, stressing the importance of comprehensive support in schools to reduce the risk of dropout, forced marriage, teenage pregnancy and infection.

Everyone should have a right to their own faith. But as with those who refuse vaccination and raise the risk of infection in others, policymakers need to stand above individuals’ views when the implications jeopardise the health of others.

We spoke to Larry Summers, professor at Harvard and former US Treasury Secretary, who has just been appointed co-chair of Michael Bloomberg's task force on fiscal policy for health and wrote about the topic this week for the FT.

Why did you decide to lead this new commission?

I’ve been concerned about these issues since I oversaw the World Development Report in 1993. I think the under-allocation of resources to global health is as serious as any [problem] in the international system. There are opportunities by promoting these kinds of taxes, developing vaccines, working on drug resistance. This has long been of concern for me. I’ve always felt that tax policy around global health is . . . low-hanging fruit. There is scope for taxes to control tobacco, alcohol and sugar.

Are you disappointed there was not faster adoption of these ideas?

There has been some uptake since the Global Health 2035 report. The global effort to stigmatise and reduce tobacco use has grown and soda taxes have been implemented in Mexico and other developing countries. No one could have conceived in 1972 of where we would be with respect to tobacco. We’re in a similar place for sugar today. There’s too little connection in general between global health and the economic and financial community. The fact that the chairs of the commission are people that finance ministers would naturally relate to will help.

Are you worried about the White House’s turn against global health?

There are grounds for concern. Obviously if you have a more outward-looking, generous-minded US, there are greater prospects for global health. But it would be a shame if people working to make the world a better place became paralysed and focused all their energies on Trump. Plus the National Security Strategy contains a reference to strengthening health systems in the developing world as an important part of protecting our national security and there is much developing countries and US cities can do.

M149c8,20/04/2018,mainstream,"Among the most striking discoveries of modern physics — if not the most striking — is that, in nature, time works differently from the familiar intuition we have of it.

Time, for instance, is not uniform: it flows at a different speed depending on where you are and how you move. In the 2014 film Interstellar, the hero travels to the vicinity of a black hole. On his return to Earth, he finds his daughter older than himself: she is an elderly lady, he is still middle-aged.

This is not Hollywood fantasy, it is how the world truly works. The film’s scientific consultant Kip Thorne has since received the Nobel Prize in physics, for his role in detecting the gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes. He knows his topic. If we do not experience similar time distortions in our daily life, it is only because here on Earth they are too small for us to notice.

It is not the first time science has shown our intuitions to be mistaken. Science is constantly learning something new, and more often than not such learning means jettisoning wrong ideas. That is why science often clashes with common sense — our intuition wants Earth to be flat and still, and time to be the same everywhere. None of this is true.

Time is a mystery that has always troubled us, stirring deep emotions. Perhaps it is because, as Buddha put it, our difficulty in dealing with impermanence (or the passage of time) is at the root of our suffering. Hans Reichenbach, in one of the most lucid books on the matter, The Direction of Time, suggested that it might have been in order to escape from this anxiety that the Greek philosopher Parmenides denied time’s existence, Plato imagined a world of ideas outside it and Hegel spoke of the moment in which the spirit transcends temporality.

It may be because of this that we have imagined the existence of “eternity”, a world outside time that we imagine inhabited by gods, a God or immortal souls. Our deeply emotional attitude towards the subject may have contributed more to the construction of cathedrals of philosophy than logic or reason did. The opposite emotional attitude — the veneration of time by thinkers such as Heraclitus or Henri Bergson — has given rise to just as many philosophies but still not brought us much nearer to understanding its reality.

Physics helps us to penetrate some layers of the mystery. But our grasp of the world is shaped by the vast dialogue that involves the whole of our culture, from physics to philosophy, literature to the neuro-sciences. All these crafts may be needed here. Physics has conclusively shown that the temporal structure of the world is different from our perception of it. It has given us the hope of being able to study the nature of time free from our emotional fog.

But in advancing towards quantum theories of gravity with a temporal structure far removed from our intuition, we end up losing our own sense of time. Just as Copernicus, by studying the revolutions of the heavens, ended up understanding that it is us rather than the sky that turns, exploring the nature of time leads us to discover something about ourselves. Perhaps, ultimately, the emotional dimension of time is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending its nature objectively. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is for us.

The uniform nature of time is scarcely the only feature where our intuition has turned out to be mistaken. To everybody’s surprise, the difference between past and future fails to show up in the elementary equations that govern the physical world. But the discovery that has been the most disconcerting of all has been finding out that the notion of “present” does not make sense in the larger universe; it only makes sense in the vicinity of us slow human critters.

“Here-and-now” is a well-defined notion in science, but “now” on its own is not. Philosophers are struggling greatly with this discovery: if we call reality that which exists now, what is reality after we have realised that there isn’t a well-defined “now” all over the universe? The very grammar we use to talk about things, in which verbs have only a past, future and present tense, is inadequate to describe the ways of nature.

In physics, a great debate on the nature of physical time has developed in an arc spanning from Aristotle to Newton and from Newton to Einstein. Our understanding has repeatedly deepened in the course of this process. For Aristotle, time is just a way to count what happens, but it becomes an autonomous flowing variable for Newton and is then reinterpreted by Einstein as a feature of the gravitational field.

Einstein’s great theory, general relativity, keeps receiving spectacular empirical support — confirming such counter-intuitive predictions as black holes, expansion of the universe, time dilation, gravitational waves and more. These give strong credibility to Einstein’s picture and continue to rule out alternative conjectures. But there is certainly more to learn.

We do not yet know the fate of matter falling into the black holes we see in the sky, where Einstein’s theory says that time comes to an end. And the full complexity of what we perceive as the flow of time is not accounted for by general relativity alone: it involves quantum theory, thermodynamics and probably more, including neuroscience and the cognitive sciences.

My own work in science has been concentrated on the effort to understand how the quantum nature of the world affects space and time. There is not yet agreement on a solution; but there is a rather large consensus around the expectation that the concept of physical time is likely to move even further away from our intuition, when its quantum properties are taken into account.

This is why reflecting on the nature of time is a constant concern for myself and many of my colleagues. Tentative theories of quantum spacetime have little that resembles time as we experience it. The basic equations of the theory on which I work, loop quantum gravity, have no special “time” variable at all. They describe processes in which things change but no single time variable can track all possible changes.

Does all this suggest our perception of time is illusory? It does not. But it indicates that what we perceive as time may not be a simple and elementary aspect of nature, but rather a complex phenomenon with many layers, each needing to be addressed by a different chapter of science. This is the true question about the nature of time: which aspects of our sense of it pertain to which domain of science?

Key aspects of time are described by the science of heat, thermodynamics. Any time the future is definitely distinguishable from the past, there is something like heat involved. Thermodynamics traces the direction of time to something called the “low entropy of the past”, a still mysterious phenomenon on which discussions rage. I have studied the hypothesis that some aspects of the solution might come from recognising a perspectival aspect for time. Think of the magnificent spectacle of the daily rotation of the sky: we see the sun, moon and stars, the entire cosmos, majestically rotating. It has taken millennia for us to understand why. To figure this out, we had to consider ourselves. It is not the vast cosmos that is rotating, it is we who live on a spinning rock. This is a perspectival explanation. Something similarly perspectival, I think, underpins our peculiar perception of the flow of time.

Entropy growth orients time and permits the existence of traces of the past, and these permit the possibility of memories, which hold together our sense of identity. I suspect that what we call the “flowing” of time has to be understood by studying the structure of our brain rather than by studying physics: evolution has shaped our brain into a machine that feeds off memory in order to anticipate the future. This is what we are listening to when we listen to the passing of time. Understanding the “flowing” of time is therefore something that may pertain to neuroscience more than to fundamental physics. Searching for the explanation of the feeling of flow in physics might be a mistake.

Our understanding depends on the neural structures shaped by the peculiar environment in which we live. They capture a very imprecise version of the actual temporal structure of reality. Our experience is an approximation of an approximation of a description of the world from our particular perspective as beings dependent on the growth of entropy, anchored to the thermodynamical arrow of time. For us, there is, as Ecclesiastes has it, a time to be born and a time to die. The time we experience is a multilayered, complex concept with distinct properties rooted in distinct layers of reality. Many parts of the full story are still far from being clear. Time remains, to a large extent, a mystery, perhaps the greatest one. A mystery that relates to issues ranging from the fate of black holes to the enigma of our individual identity and consciousness.

Will we be able to understand things better in the future? I think so. Our understanding of nature has increased vertiginously over the course of the centuries, and we are continuing to learn. We are glimpsing something about the mystery of time. We can see the world described by quantum theories of gravity: we can perceive with the mind’s eye the profound structure of the world where time as we know it no longer exists — just as Paul McCartney’s “Fool on the Hill” sees the world spinning round when he sees the sun going down.

I also think we are beginning to see that we are time. We are this clearing opened by the traces of memory inside the connections between our neurons. We are memory. We are nostalgia. We are longing for a future that will not come. Horace, the greatest poet of Roman antiquity and perhaps the greatest cantor of time, calls it our “brief circle” (“You must be wise. Pour the wine/and enclose in this brief circle/your long-cherished hope”). This clearing, opened up for us by memory and anticipation, is our time: a source of anguish on occasion, but in the end the marvellous gift of our existence.

M197e5,24/09/2006,mainstream,"The web has been buzzing this weekend with discussion of Sir Richard Branson’s decision to devote $3bn to alternative energy, announced at the Clinton Global Initiative. Chris Hughes explained in Saturday’s FT how this “amounts to a massive ‘asset allocation’ switch out of transport and into green energy” and he went on to ask if this was wise. But the bloggers (see below) have been providing their own answers.

There has been a very sensible discussion on the Warwick University blog site about whether Branson’s move was philanthropy or business.

Other bloggers are clear that this is business, pure and simple. “The man is a genius, he can’t lose!” according to Wonko’s World. “The State of California has just launched a lawsuit against major car companies over climate change and the oil market is volatile, not to say finite. Biofuels are a renewable source of energy and can be grown by or for the company that produces it. Biofuel is cheaper than oil-based products and cleaner to make. A large percentage of the Virgin empire is transport-related and cheap fuel will improve the profitability of those businesses. On top of that, I expect that Virgin Fuels will retain the patent on new technologies they develop meaning that they can rake in the cash in from selling the technology to other people.”

Moonage Spacedream picks up the theme. “Branson is making a very prudent, well thought out, business decision. Instead of paying someone else for 700 million gallons of gasoline every year, he’s going to make his own fuel,” he says. “Plus, he’s going to get tax credits [….] for doing it (see Clear Skies Initiative), tax credits for building the plants, tax credits for using the fuel, and even more tax credits for buying the waste to make the fuel. This is an absolute no-brainer for a forward thinking business genius like Richard Branson. Plus, he’ll get every tree-hugger on the planet flying Virgin. Slam dunk business decision.”

And Andy Rowell, on Oil Change International, says Branson’s plan amounts to “clever green marketing”. He goes on: “Air transport was exempted from the Kyoto protocol on climate change, provided that airlines sought a way to reduce emissions through a trading scheme by 2007. With that deadline fast approaching and no agreement in sight, the prospect of taxes on aviation fuel or airline travel is becoming more realistic. This latest scheme by Branson could be a clever move to pre-empt that.”

Others are more critical. “Throwing $3 billion out there without goals, commitments, and initiatives doesn’t do anything except get publicity,” says Idioticblog.

Yet, says, Kyla’s Economics blog: “Some people may say that this is just for publicity and to gain more fame or power, but even if it is that, which I do not fully believe, he is still doing a huge favour to our environment. So I say thank you, and I also say stop being so lazy people and actually start doing something!”

Confessing Evangelical wonders whether Branson is not simply misguided. The blog cites an article in the New Scientist which says: “Far from solving our problems, say the dissenters, biofuels will trash rainforests, suck water reserves dry, kill off species and raise food prices. They will also accelerate the corporate takeover of agriculture, create famines and could leave fuel importers as dependent as ever on other countries. Worst of all, many biofuels will barely slow global warming at all if the technology behind them does not improve.”

We have fresh stories, of course, for tomorrow’s paper. Norma Cohen and Sarah Spikes have been checking out news in The Sunday Times of merger talks between the London Stock Exchange and Icap, the inter-dealer broker run by Michael Spencer. A story is running on FT.com now (the talks were brief and are now off) but we will have more analysis on Monday morning, online and in print. We also have a couple of good scoops of our own on derivatives, hedge funds, pensions, the business of the internet and plenty more, all of which will be on FT.com later."
M1eb4c,16/05/2016,mainstream,"When Islamist gunmen stormed the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in 2013 the ensuing gunfight with security forces eventually left 67 dead and many wounded. It also resulted in $78m of insured property losses.

“The military that went in to contain the situation went in very hard and created an awful lot of property damage,” says Tim Davies, head of sabotage and terrorism at Lloyd’s underwriter Sompo Canopius. This made Westgate one of the 20 costliest terrorist attacks from an insurance perspective and highlighted how terrorism is changing.

Inhabitants of the world’s major cities have witnessed the rise of new types of terror strike, where an individual or small group, apparently loosely affiliated to global terror networks, attacks soft targets such as shopping centres and music venues, intent on killing as many civilians as possible.

These attacks contrast with the high-profile targets and central orchestration of the likes of the September 11 attacks in the US in 2001, which aimed for mass destruction.

As terrorists have changed their strategies, insurers have had to adapt their business models and review the coverage they offer. Behind the human cost of sporadic assaults by small groups of terrorists is the damage to property and interruption of trading.

More than 170 people were killed in last November’s Paris attack and the follow-up assault in Brussels this March, including 10 perpetrators. The cost of the physical damage to property was exceeded by the widespread business interruption as authorities responded by shutting down parts of the cities.

“The size of the areas affected by cordons and police closures was almost unprecedented,” says Julian Enoizi, chief executive of Pool Re, the mutual reinsurer set up by the UK government in 1993 in response to the IRA bombing campaign. Most of the UK’s insurers are members of Pool Re, which provides a guarantee, backed by the UK Treasury, to cover any losses from terrorism.

Larger businesses often have insurance and disaster recovery plans to get back up and running quickly. But smaller companies typically do not. Pool Re has developed a discounted, bespoke version of terrorism insurance for small and medium businesses, but has work to do to encourage take-up. The reinsurer estimates less than 5 per cent of small businesses have terrorism insurance policies.

“Part of this is to ensure that business owners understand the true nature and scale of terrorist threats that face the UK,” says Mr Enoizi.

The increased incidence of attacks by smaller groups of terrorists in western cities has been met with rising demand for insurance against event cancellation, denial of access losses — where an attack means that the business owners and customers cannot get into the building — and third-party liabilities.

The latter, called ‘liability terrorism’ by some in the industry, would protect an insured business against being pursued for liabilities after an attack. An example would be a hotel without adequate security measures or a public space where evacuation procedures failed.

In the US, “active shooter” policies insure universities and other institutions against costs arising from a lone shooter rampaging on their property. These are designed to protect them against legal liability if they are judged to have failed to prevent an attack.

But thinking solely in terms of small groups can understate how advanced terrorist attacks are becoming. “There is an increased sophistication now from five years ago,” says Wendy Peters, terrorism practice leader at consultancy Willis Towers Watson, pointing to the plan by the recent Brussels bombers to target a nuclear power plant.

Another emerging threat to which insurers are having to adapt is the potential damage caused by attacks on digital infrastructure. Cyber hackers, which security experts believe may have been backed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, have made headlines with attacks targeting banks, oil companies and even dams.

But cyber insurance does not fall neatly into terrorism insurance, as it is often difficult to establish the perpetrators’ identity. In one of the best-known examples that included property destruction, reports emerged in 2014 that hackers had compromised the computer systems of a German steel mill, causing huge damage to a blast furnace. There was a similar attack on a Turkish oil pipeline six years earlier.

“Was it a terrorist, nation state, disgruntled employee?” asks Mr Enoizi of these acts. The consensus among security analysts is that terrorists without state or insider support do not yet have the technical resources to conduct a cyber attack, but Pool Re is conducting a wide-ranging study on the nature of this threat, the capability of the terrorists and the size of the losses that could be incurred.

Insurers expect further cyber terror attacks to follow. “If and when terrorists have the capability to utilise a cyber capability as a weapon, then they will,” says Mr Enoizi. “That threat may be one that only a mechanism such as Pool Re can deal with, given the potential scale of losses.”

Lloyd’s insurer Novae Group says it has seen a huge increase in inquiries and take-up for cyber insurance in the past few years, though it does not provide numbers. Novae says the policies are no longer primarily focused on data privacy.

Dan Trueman, head of Novae’s cyber division, says: “We have moved beyond privacy towards policies that focus more on the first-party consequences, namely business interruption, reputational damage and system failure.”

The work still to do is about quantifying the risk and developing services that can manage it. But property owners are increasingly accepting that they can be subject to cyber attacks, and be affected by attacks by small groups of terrorists, which they would not have even considered until just a few years ago."
M0c32f,17/07/2006,mainstream,"The Argentine city of Córdoba will on Thursday provide the setting for some mutual celebration by the presidents of the Mercosur’s new big three – Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. Now that President Hugo Chávez has brought his considerable oil reserves and growing financial pull to the services of regional economic integration it is difficult to see how the group will not make more progress towards constructing better infrastructure. Sure, some of the money will be squandered if the group persists in poorly thought-out initiatives, such as the 8,000 kilometre gas pipeline that is to straddle the continent.

But the bigger challenges will be to preserve the pact’s viability as a trading entity and make more progress towards a genuine free market. The competitive adaptation mechanism – that provides for threatened sectors to deploy protection – may make good sense for inefficient Argentine producers, but it is mightily frustrating for more Brazilian groups. And, as this editorial in the pro-business O Estado de São Paulo points out, it may also undermine the group’s ability to compete as a whole against China.

While Argentina has been blocking Brazilian shoe exports, those from China have been growing apace, nearly doubling in the five months to May 2006, for example.

Containing the discontent of Uruguay and Paraguay will also be a problem. Argentina’s President Néstor Kirchner still seems set to persist in his campaign to deny Uruguay the right to build a paper and pulp industry, in spite of his overwhelming defeat last week in the International Court of Justice. Environmental protesters will make their grievances known at Córdoba, after already costing Uruguay’s economy losses of $400m with roadblocks on the border between the two countries earlier this year. Argentina’s government has done nothing to prevent such protests in the past, even though they directly contradicted Mercosur’s basic aim to promote the free movement of people and goods.

Meanwhile, yet another trade dispute involving Argentina shows that it is not a propitious time to be looking for further expansion of the five-nation bloc. Chile – an associate member – is particularly vexed that Argentina has announced it will raise fuel prices in frontier areas for foreign vehicles, fearing they are taking advantage of prices half those in Chile. That comes after Argentina irritated its neighbour by directly passing on the increased cost of its own Bolivian gas imports to the gas that it sells to Chile. Bolivia negotiated a sharp increase earlier this month.

After appearing in Córdoba and a fleeting stop-over in Brazil, Mr Chávez begins a tour that will take in Russia, Belarus, Iran, Qatar and Vietnam.

Hawkish US officials hoping to alternatively brand Mr Chávez’s trip as his “axis of evil” tour might be disappointed to learn that North Korea has – at least officially – been knocked off the tour dates. Still, it wouldn’t be the first time Mr Chávez harbours a surprise. Watch for a red carpet being rolled out in Pyongyang. If he does expect criticism, even – judging by this recent piece from Larry Birns and the Council on Hemispheric Affairs – from those normally sympathetic to the Chávez camp.

In any event at least two things that will irk Washington’s officialdom. Firstly, Mr Chávez will lobby for support to win a seat on the United Nations Security Council – this tour follows a diplomatic vote-hunting safari two weeks’ ago at the African Union summit in Gambia.

Secondly, in Moscow, he is expected to ink a contract to buy 24 (or more) Sukhoi fighter jets and sign an agreement with his counterpart Vladimir Putin that would allow Russia to send a Venezuelan military officer into space.

Alejandro Toledo has had a commendable late surge of energy in the twilight days of his presidency, personally lobbying members of the US Congress to support a trade agreement with Peru. (see the full text of the treaty)

Mr Toledo is hoping that his last-minute schmoozing will overcome opposition on Capitol Hill from minority members such as Sander Levin, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, who are concerned about lax labour standards in the Andes. (see Levin’s objections)

Unfortunately, Alan García, who will be sworn in as president next week (July 28), has shown no such leadership on the issue, flip-flopping between backhanded support and half-hearted opposition.

During the election campaign, Mr García pandered to concerns among agricultural producers in Peru by promising to revise the treaty “chapter by chapter and point by point”. After his narrow victory he changed his mind and gave his congressional bloc the green light to OK the deal. Now he is again vowing to “renegotiate” sections of the agreement.

The idea that Washington will re-open talks and change agreed terms is either hopelessly naïve or wilfully deceptive. The incoming government has been complaining about the Toledo administration handing over “time bombs” whose consequences it will have to bear.

Mr García could defuse the possibility that the trade deal will blow up in his face by stating clearly his support for the agreement and its benefits for Peru.

Relations between President George W. Bush’s Washington and Evo Morales’s La Paz were never going to be easy. Before he was elected, the radical Bolivian unionist warned that he would be a “nightmare” for the US.

But when Morales was inaugurated in January, there seemed to be a warming of relations. Tom Shannon, the US state department’s Latin America man, breakfasted with Mr Morales at his kitchen table in La Paz, and the incoming president welcomed him warmly in his speech in Congress. Mr Bush later called Mr Morales to congratulate him on his stunning election victory.

Since then it has all gone downhill fast. In February, Donald Rumsfeld, the US defence secretary, said Mr Morales’s election was “clearly worrisome”. Adolfo Franco, the assistant administrator of the USAID, warned in testimony to Congress last month that Mr Morales has demonstrated “inclinations to consolidate executive power and promote potentially anti-democratic reforms”.

Mr Morales’s attacks on the US have become more frequent and more grave. From having complained about Washington’s failure to supply visas to some members of his administration, in May he moved on to saying the US was planning to assassinate him. Last month Mr Morales accused the CIA of covertly training agents in Santa Cruz, in south-eastern Bolivia.

La Paz’s decision to “nationalise” Bolivia’s vast gas reserves have not helped endear it to Washington. But the worsening relationship cannot be put down to nationalisation, which has barely affected US companies. Nor has it a great deal to do with concerns over the slowing eradication of coca, the raw material for cocaine. US officials privately admit that since most Bolivian cocaine is bound for Brazil and Europe, it is less problematic for them than Colombian production.

Instead, the lost opportunity promised by the Shannon-Morales breakfast scene is due to ideological myopia and loose lips. Both Washington and La Paz have their own domestic reasons for bashing each other, and both have preferred to take a strong line rather than compromise.

Mr Morales’s paranoia is probably egged on by his increasingly close relationship with Hugo Chávez, the loudmouthed Venezuelan leader who has swaggered through Bolivia frequently since it swung into his “axis of good”.

Mr Bush’s monofocus on trade as the only way to engage with Latin America could backfire in Bolivia. The administration has made it clear it will not extend beyond this year the tariff preferences currently enjoyed by South America’s poorest country. That is designed to persuade La Paz to follow a more market-friendly course – but could play into anti-American sentiment.

Mr Morales has formally asked the US to extend the preferences for another year, something Washington looks likely to refuse. That may enable him to point another accusing finger at the Bush administration when Bolivian industry starts to suffer.

The most noteworthy of the controversy surrounding President Néstor Kirchner’s proposed new powers is how little effort Argentina’s leader makes to justify the reform and how much he spends lambasting critics. Within the last week, Mr Kirchner has been “pained” by the opposition Radical Party, the conservative newspaper La Nación and other quarters. Yet, the reforms have been justified rather blandly as “putting things in order”

On the surface at least the laws do give genuine cause for concern. Steamrolled through the senate last week and due to be approved by the lower house possibly as early as Wednesday, the legislation allows the executive to alter the budget without congressional approval. Other new laws increase the government’s scope to use emergency executive decrees. There appears to be little justification. The economic crisis that justified the original budgetary short circuit (introduced in April 2001 at the behest of Domingo Cavallo) has long since passed, for example. Indeed, on the contrary, following the controversial law undermining judicial independence earlier this year, it all reinforces the worrying sense that Mr Kirchner is out to concentrate to power.

Juan Manuel Santos is gearing up for his first day behind the desk as President Álvaro Uribe’s minister of defence in Bogotá.

Mr Santos takes the helm of the defence ministry – arguably the most important post in the Colombian cabinet – as a reward for his leading role in two crucial political campaigns: Mr Uribe’s recent landslide re-election victory and, in March, elections that handed the president considerable control over the legislature.

In the past, Mr Santos has been an outspoken critic of Mr Chávez, arguing that the Venezuelan leader poses a threat to Colombia’s national security, both because of his arms purchases and because of Mr Chávez’s overt international ambitions. Hawks in the Colombian military’s top brass are likely to reinforce that view.

Yet Mr Santos is a shrewd politician and undoubtedly loyal to the president. Mr Uribe has signalled that, despite the concerns, it is a pragmatic stance towards Mr Chávez that best serves Colombia’s national interest, rather than shooting from the hip.

M0ecf1,08/05/2015,mainstream,"In December 1969, an unknown band called Badfinger released “Come and Get It”, a catchy pop song written by Paul McCartney, who had given it to the band to help them break into the charts.

It worked. But it was the wrong song for the wrong band at the wrong time. Watch their performance on Top of the Pops: the group — earnest and long-haired — seem almost embarrassed by the song’s primary-coloured glibness. This was the end of the 1960s. Music was getting darker, more complicated. Surely they could do better than that.

While McCartney’s ditty was giving them instant chart recognition, two of the group’s members, Pete Ham and Tom Evans, were hatching a more dramatic song back in their Golders Green bedsits. “Without You” was written about the two men’s relationships with their girlfriends: Ham wrote the verse, Evans the chorus. The song was full of epic observations on the fragility of love.

“No I can’t forget tomorrow, When I think of all my sorrow, When I had you there, But then I let you go,” wrote Ham of his romantic entanglement; “I can’t live, if living is without you,” said Evans of his own. The band performed the song with little sense of conviction or self-belief. It was buried, along with its tired, plodding arrangement, on the end of side one on their 1970 album No Dice.

Harry Nilsson was an American singer-songwriter who was famous for a song he didn’t write: the lovely “Everybody’s Talkin”, Fred Neil’s get-away-from-it-all folk tune, which became the theme of 1969’s Midnight Cowboy. Now, at a party, he heard Badfinger’s “Without You”, another song with potential (legend has it that he thought it was written by The Beatles: easy to believe).

Nilsson got together with American producer Richard Perry and they transformed the song, which was a hit in early 1972. A two-note piano intro leads into Nilsson’s tender, high vocal. The fragility of love is given its appropriate arrangement. An orchestral backing is subtly hued, and the slide into the chorus tastefully negotiated.

But then, on the first repetition of “I can’t live, if living is without you”, Nilsson lets himself go. It is the moment when resignation turns into something hotter and wilder. “I can’t give, I can’t give any more,” Nilsson sings, desperately, and you cannot but believe him. He turns the delicate song into what would later be known as a power ballad; except that he himself is powerless, vanquished by his dependency.

The song was a massive hit all over the world. It became a standard, recorded by some 180 artists and, of course a karaoke favourite, if you were really far gone. And then, in 1994, it emerged again, this time from the formidable vocal cords of Mariah Carey.

Her version is smooth, polished, breathy, crowded with melismatic flourishes. It is everything that continues to be wrong with popular balladry today. The fragility is gone, the tentativeness nowhere to be found. On a video of a live performance, you can hear the audience revving up during each crescendo of the chorus.

“I can’t live,” sings Carey, but she is only girding herself for greater glory. At the end of the song, a gospel choir joins in: of course it does. “No, I can’t live, No I can’t live.” The song, released the week after Nilsson’s death from a heart attack at the age of 52, was a huge success.

What is it like to feel like you can’t live? The song’s writers, Pete Ham and Tom Evans, both knew. They hanged themselves, in separate incidents, Ham in 1975, Evans in 1983. Among their concerns had been ongoing rows about royalties from “Without You”. People talked of the “curse” of Badfinger. The band that wanted to get away from simple pop songs, and delve into the darker waters of human despair.

As this plays out, the vast majority of the human race will be removed from the gene pool. Genetically annihilated. Will you and your genetic lineage survive?

It is being done through chemicals added to our drinking water, food, medicines, and the air we breathe – chemicals that have the known effect of reducing fertility and shortening lifespan.

This documentary is the first of a three-part series. It shows how additives to our drinking water, such as fluoride, supposedly to combat tooth decay, in reality, are covert doses of death. It also shows how you can protect yourself and your family.

Film-makers Paul Wittenberger and Chris Maple explore WHAT are the real threats to your life, your offspring and your genetic integrity?"
C0045e,17/01/2017,conspiracy,"An Inconvenient Tooth is a documentary film about the water fluoridation controversy which arises from moral, ethical, political, and safety concerns regarding the fluoridation of public water supplies.

The controversy occurs mainly in English-speaking countries, as Continental Europe does not practice water fluoridation. Instead, fluoride is added to most table salt in Europe.

Those opposed argue that water fluoridation imposes ethical issues, may cause serious health problems, is not effective enough to justify the costs, and has a dosage that cannot be precisely controlled.

Fluoride , is an inorganic, monatomic anion of fluorine with the chemical formula is an inorganic, monatomic anion of fluorine with the chemical formula Fluoride is the simplest anion of fluorine. Its salts and minerals are important chemical reagents and industrial chemicals, mainly used in the production of hydrogen fluoride for fluorocarbons. In terms of charge and size, the fluoride ion resembles the hydroxide ion. Fluoride ions occur on earth in several minerals, particularly fluorite, but are only present in trace quantities in water. Fluoride contributes a distinctive bitter taste. It contributes no colour to fluoride salts.

Here are a few excerpts from an article by Dr. Edward Group:

Fluoride is one of the most toxic substances known to man, yet based on its inclusion in virtually every brand of toothpaste, the American Dental Association believes it’s okay to use fluoride for preventative dental care. Other products, such as bottled water, infant formulas, and even vitamin supplements, now contain fluoride!

In 2002, nearly 90% of the U.S. population was supplied water via public water systems, and around 67% of that number received fluoridated water. This occurred in spite of the fact, “No statistically significant differences were found in the decay rates of permanent teeth or the percentages of decay-free children in the fluoridated, non-fluoridated, and partially fluoridated areas.”

Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) typically label sodium fluoride as “…toxic by ingestion, inhalation and skin contact” and that PPE (personal protection equipment) for handling should include safety glasses and gloves. Fluorides are more toxic than lead and only slightly less poisonous than arsenic… and these toxins can enter your body from brushing your teeth or rinsing with many popular dental care products!

Every year Poison Control centers receive thousands of calls from people reporting excessive consumption of fluoride-containing products, such as vitamins, toothpaste, mouthwash, etc. Fluoride poisoning severely damages the body and can be fatal. This lethal chemical creates a toxic state that can cause a variety of harmful effects."

Medical consensus is that these experiences are hallucinations, the result of delusional disorders or psychosis, the same sources from which arise religious delusions, accounts of alien abductions, and beliefs in visitations from dead relatives. It can be difficult to persuade people who experience them that their belief in an external influence is delusional.

We’ll use a small excerpt from The Guardian to accompany the Audiobook as it nicely sets the stage for what the book is about.

John Perkins was recruited as a young man by the National Security Agency – somewhat to his surprise, considering that in his interview he had been grilled on his youthful insubordination, friendships with suspicious foreigners, and sexual frustrations.

It turns out that it doesn’t hurt to be a bit damaged in the NSA’s eyes – it makes you more biddable. He was then employed by Chas T Main, a company whose competitors included Bechtel and Halliburton, of which you may have heard. As to what Main’s business was, Perkins says that “during my first months there even I could not figure out what we did”.

He found out eventually. Ostensibly an economist, his job was to go off to developing countries, offer them enormous loans with which to improve their infrastructures and provide wildly inflated projections of the economic growth these improvements would bring.

Presented to the right people, these bogus figures did the trick, a deliberately underhand assault on a nation’s de facto sovereignty. Contractors – US contractors, naturally – would move in and build the pipelines or the drilling platforms or the power stations, the economy would fail to grow anything like as fast as predicted, the country would default on its loan, and so find itself in hook to the US in perpetuity – or until it underwent revolutionary regime change. The textbook case of this is Iran, where Perkins found himself a very short time before the fall of the shah

Things didn’t work out quite as planned there. (Although the seeds of that debacle had been sown, as Perkins reminds us, in 1951, when Kermit Roosevelt, Theodore’s grandson, helped to cause the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh by, among other things, stirring up Muslim leaders to instigate revolt.

You will also find references, in other chapters, to the money the US gave Osama bin Laden. But there were plenty of places where the strategy had worked: a few families in the target countries would become immeasurably wealthier, the poor would become poorer, the money lent would often, after the enriching process, do little more than move around various banks within the US, and if anyone at the top grumbled or refused to play ball, they could be assassinated.

Few assert, and fewer believe, that the death of Panama’s Omar Torrijos in 1981 was accidental. Anyway, it’s all here, in toe-curling detail, and after reading it you will find the fictional exploits of the kind of people we imagine to work as undercover agents turn your stomach with their mendacious disconnection from reality.

One question that bothers me is how come Perkins himself has not been assassinated or silenced.

C016a9,25/09/2016,conspiracy,"Pictures and videos have been posted by the Pentagon online showing that US forces in Iraq have used white phosphorus munitions, a chemical weapon that burns deep into human tissue while suffocating the victims.

White phosphorus can cause injuries and death in three ways: by burning deep into tissue, by being inhaled as a smoke, and by being ingested. Extensive exposure by burning and ingestion may result in death. Phosphorus burns carry a greater risk of mortality than other forms of burns due to the absorption of phosphorus into the body through the burned area, resulting in liver, heart and kidney damage, and in some cases multiple organ failure. [source]

Based on images posted on Pentagon-managed public affairs website,DVIDS, The Washington Post reported on Friday that a US Army artillery unit was using the controversial chemical weapon in Iraq.

The weapon, which was identified by the Post as M825A1 155mm rounds, are generally used to make smoke screens or signals for advancing troops.

But when used in civilian-populated areas, the munitions can cause horrific injuries that can even be dangerous for medics treating the wounds, according to the report.

When asked if the forces had used the munitions for anything other than screening, obscuring or marking, John Dorrian, a spokesman for the US-led coalition in Iraq, refused to explain, the report said.

Dorrian said white phosphorus munitions had been “used generally for the circumstances which I described,” but did not say if they had been used in the town, with or without the presence of civilians.

RT News cover the story in the following video, please be warned, some viewers may find the footage disturbing:

Eight-year-old Razia was brought to U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan 2009, after being severely burned. The 8-year-old’s skin was smoking from white phosphorus.

When Razia was taken to the Air Base, the US military doctors watched in horror as the oxygen mask on the young Afghan girl’s face started to melt, Captain Autumn Richards explained.

Razia’s father Aziz is convinced international forces fired the round that destroyed his home. French troops in green armoured personnel carriers, U.S. troops in tan Humvees and Afghan soldiers gathered nearby before the attack, Aziz, Raiz’s father said. Two US officials told The Associated Press that the battle was primarily a French operation.

They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to release the nationality of the force involved. Razia has discharged and moved to her home in , Tagab district, Kapisa province, Afghanistan. Razia needs help in many ways, but the best for her future would be a chance to live in a developed country where her need could be better met than Afghanistan. The primary target country should be France, as reports suggest she was injured in an attack led by French troops.

White phosphorus munitions, while not specifically banned by international law, are restricted from use in indiscriminate attacks against civilians by the 1983 UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. White phosphorus ignites on contact with oxygen and causes deep skin burns.

The United States previously admitted to using white phosphorus during the Iraq war in 2004, but denied the weapons were used against civilians. The munitions have also been used by NATO in Afghanistan. [Source]

The US have also come under scrutiny over their sales of White Phosphorus munitions to Saudi Arabia, which then have been used in Yemen, Mintpress News reports:

Amid new evidence that Saudi Arabia has begun to use white phosphorus munitions in their war in Yemen, US officials are admitting that the weapons were provided by the United States “in the past.” They declined to say when, or how many weapons were provided.

The US has faced growing pressure in recent months over arms sales to Saudi Arabia, as their airstrikes in Yemen have caused massive numbers of civilian casualties. US officials have tried to downplay the matter, so far, but every new disastrous airstrike adds to the calls from international human rights groups for the US to stop abetting the kingdom’s war crimes.

The US also supplied White Phosphorus to Israel, who used the weapon on Gaza:

Israel denied using WP at first, but admitted to using it in Gaza under media pressure. It said the WP was used as an obscurant and illuminant, but even this type of use is banned in civilian areas under the Geneva Convention. According to Sputnik News, in 2009 the U.S. State Department confirmed that WP weapons from its Arkansas plant were sent to Israel for use in the Gaza invasion. [source]

It’s also worth mentioning where the White Phosphorus is being sourced, none other than Monsanto. The agricultural biotech giant who has recently been brought by Bayer have a history of providing death giving products to the World, beginning with Agent Orange chemical which was used in Vietnam to murder thousands, while leaving a long trail of birth defects and illness to the survivors:

“The Government is aware of only one source, Monsanto, who currently manufactures WP in the US. WP requires specialized technology, skills and processes in its production. These technologies and skills must be protected within the NTIB [National Technology and Industrial Base, a term for the “persons and organizations that are engaged in research, development, production, integration, services, or information technology activities conducted within the United States and Canada”] in the event of a national emergency. […] Maintaining these skills within the NTIB is essential if the capability to produce WP is to be preserved. Without this restriction to the NTIB, there is a risk the domestic capacity to manufacture WP could be lost […] With only one known producer of WP in the NTIB (Monsanto), the Government’s support of this domestic capability is critically important as it reduces the risk to the war fighter in times of national emergency as well as avoiding a potentially dangerous dependency upon a foreign source.” [Source]

It’s worth bearing in mind that the following list is only confirmed, known cases of this weapon being used. Few Governments will admit usage unless they get caught out or have no other option but to admit their intention of usage.

White phosphorus was used by Saddam Hussein during the Halabja poison gas attack. According to an undated ANSA article quoted by an RAI documentary, on the morning of March 16, 1988, the Iraqi Air Force bombed Halabja several times with a chemical cocktail of yperite, tabun, VX, napalm and white phosphorus.” White phosphorus had not been previously mentioned in other reports on Halabja, but the use of napalm was commonly reported.

In April 2004, during the First Battle of Fallujah, Darrin Mortenson of California’s North County Times reported that white phosphorus was used as an incendiary weapon. Embedded with the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, Mortenson described a Marine mortar team using a mixture of white phosphorus and high explosives to shell a cluster of buildings where insurgents had been spotted throughout the week.

In November 2004, during the Second Battle of Fallujah, Washington Post reporters embedded with Task Force 2-2, Regimental Combat Team 7, wrote on November 9, 2004 that “Some artillery guns fired white phosphorus (WP) rounds that create a screen of fire that cannot be extinguished with water.” Insurgents reported being attacked with a substance that melted their skin, a reaction consistent with white phosphorus burns.

On November 9, 2005 the Italian state-run broadcaster Radiotelevisione Italiana S.p.A. aired a documentary titled “Fallujah, The Hidden Massacre”, alleging that the United States used white phosphorus as a weapon in Fallujah causing insurgents and civilians to be killed or injured by chemical burns. The filmmakers further claimed that the United States used incendiary MK-77 bombs in violation of Protocol III of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, quoted in the documentary, white phosphorus is permitted for use as an illumination device and as a weapon with regard to heat energy, but not permitted as an offensive weapon with regard to its toxic chemical properties. The documentary also included footage which purported to be of white phosphorus being fired from helicopters over Fallujah. It also quoted journalist Giuliana Sgrena, who had been in Fallujah, as a testimony.

On November 15, 2005, U.S. Department of Defense spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Barry Venable confirmed to the BBC that white phosphorus had been used as an incendiary antipersonnel weapon in Fallujah. Venable stated “When you have enemy forces that are in covered positions that your high explosive artillery rounds are not having an impact on and you wish to get them out of those positions, one technique is to fire a white phosphorus round into the position because the combined effects of the fire and smoke – and in some case the terror brought about by the explosion on the ground – will drive them out of the holes so that you can kill them with high explosives.”

On November 16, 2005, BBC News reported that an article published in the March–April 2005 issue of Field Artillery, a U.S. Army magazine, noted that white phosphorus had been used during the battle. According to the article written by a captain, a first lieutenant, and a sergeant, “WP [White Phosphorus] proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breeches and, later in the fight, as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes where we could not get effects on them with HE [High Explosives]. We fired “shake and bake” missions at the insurgents, using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out.”BBC News noted that the article had been discovered by bloggers after the US ambassador in London, Robert Holmes Tuttle, stated that US forces do not use napalm or white phosphorus as weapons.

On November 22, 2005, the Iraqi government stated it would investigate the use of white phosphorus in the battle of Fallujah. On November 30, 2005, General Peter Pace stated that white phosphorus munitions were a “legitimate tool of the military” used to illuminate targets and create smokescreens, saying “It is not a chemical weapon. It is an incendiary. And it is well within the law of war to use those weapons as they’re being used, for marking and for screening”.

During the 2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict, Israel admitted that it had used phosphorus shells “against military targets in open ground” in south Lebanon. Israel clarified that its use of the white phosphorus bombs was permitted under international conventions. President of Lebanon Émile Lahoud claimed that phosphorus shells were used against civilians in Lebanon. The first Lebanese official complaint about the use of phosphorus came from Information Minister Ghazi Aridi.

In its early statements the Israeli military repeatedly denied using white phosphorus, saying “We categorically deny the use of white phosphorus”, and “The IDF acts only in accordance with what is permitted by international law and does not use white phosphorus.” It eventually admitted its use and stopped using the shells, however, saying that a “media buzz” led to its decision to do so.

Numerous reports from human right groups during the war indicated that white phosphorus shells were being used by Israel in populated areas.

Human Rights Watch said shells exploded over populated civilian areas, including a crowded Palestinian refugee camp and a United Nations school where civilians were seeking refuge. Additionally, Human Rights Watch said that white phosphorus injuries were suspected in the cases of ten burn victims. The International Red Cross stated that phosphorus weapons had been used in the conflict but would not comment publicly on the legality of Israel’s use of the weapon, pending further investigation, contrary to what had been attributed to the ICRC in a number of media reports.

Human Rights Watch said its experts in the region had witnessed the use of white phosphorus. Kenneth Roth, the organisation’s executive director, added: “This is a chemical compound that burns structures and burns people. It should not be used in populated areas.”

Amnesty International said a fact-finding team found “indisputable evidence of the widespread use of white phosphorus” in crowded civilian residential areas of Gaza City and elsewhere in the territory.Donatella Rovera, the head of an Amnesty fact-finding mission to southern Israel and Gaza, said: “Israeli forces used white phosphorus and other weapons supplied by the United States to carry out serious violations of international humanitarian law, including war crimes.”

On 5 January the Times reported that telltale smoke associated with white phosphorus had been seen in areas of a shelling. On 12 January it was reported that more than 50 phosphorus burns victims were in Nasser Hospital. On 16 January the UNRWA headquarters was hit with phosphorus munitions. As a result of the hit, the compound was set ablaze.

Many other observers, including Human Rights Watch military experts, reported seeing white phosphorus air bursts over Gaza City and the Jabalya refugee camp. The BBC published a photograph of two shells exploding over a densely populated area on 11 January.

There are confirmed cases of white phosphorus burns on bodies of civilians wounded in Afghanistan US-Taliban clashes near Bagram. The United States has accused Taliban militants of using white phosphorus weapons illegally on at least 44 occasions. In May 2009, Colonel Gregory Julian, a spokesman for General David McKiernan, the overall commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, confirmed that Western military forces in Afghanistan use white phosphorus in order to illuminate targets or as an incendiary to destroy bunkers and enemy equipment. The Afghan government later launched an investigation into the use of white phosphorus munitions.

Houthi fighters in Yemen claimed Saudi warplanes dropped phosphorus bombs on villages in north Yemen in November 2009. The Saudi government denied military use of phosphorus munitions against the rebels, saying they were flares, not phosphorus.

Allegations of use in Ukraine (2014)

There have been multiple claims from Russian media about Ukraine using white phosphorus against rebels and civilians in the War in Donbass. According to Human Rights Watch, some of the videos presented as evidence were misrepresented copies of footage from Fallujah in 2004 and others offered did not depict white phosphorus, according to their arms researchers. Human Rights Watch also noted that this was not “the first time that Russian state media has manufactured montages about eastern Ukraine, twisted the truth, or outright misstated facts.”

After the 2016 Armenian–Azerbaijani clashes Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that on 10 May of that year the Armenian military had fired 122-mm calibre white phosphorus munitions against Azerbaijani territory."

They found that of the 55 who had worked as haematology oncology medical reviewers for the FDA from 2001 to 2010, 15 had gone on to work with or consult in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition to the pharmaceutical industry’s influence in the FDA, one agency reports3 that in 2018 alone, $9.35 billion was spent on educating and entertaining doctors — that’s more than double the 2013 figure of $4.34 billion.

Big Pharma also keeps a hand in research to ensure their drugs are approved. For instance, when there are significant or severe forms of clinical trial violations in research using human participants, these are classified as an official action indicated, or OAI. In a review4 of FDA inspection reports from 1998 to 2013, researchers found 60 clinical trials classified as OAI used for data in 78 published articles.

Of those, only three mentioned violations found by the FDA including fraud, incompetence and misconduct. In other words, anyone using medical journal data to make decisions may find those decisions are based on fraudulent or heavily flawed published studies.

The BMJ launched a global initiative calling for a reduction in the commercial influence in health care moving toward transparency. In a press release published at the same time as the first article in the collection,5 BMJ’s editor-in-chief, Dr. Fiona Godlee, said:6

“Patients and the public deserve to have evidence they can trust. Commercial influence has no place in scientific research, nor in the education and guidance of clinicians, nor in decisions about diagnosis and treatment. We hope that people around the world support our call for fundamental reforms.”

The journal plans to add more content to the collection to further understanding of the conflict of interest between commercial Industries and medical decisions.7 They brought together experts from eight nations in medicine, law and philosophy to propose fundamental cultural changes with the intention of moving away from commercial influence and closer toward independence.

In trying to balance overtesting, overdiagnosis and overtreatment against necessary procedures for diagnosis, the experts want to ensure dissemination of valid evidence “conducted as independently as possible from industries profiting from their use.” They go on to say:8“Some see transparency as the best strategy, while others regard it as necessary but insufficient. We argue that endemic financial entanglement is distorting the production and use of healthcare evidence, causing harm to individuals and waste for health systems.”

“Some see transparency as the best strategy, while others regard it as necessary but insufficient. We argue that endemic financial entanglement is distorting the production and use of healthcare evidence, causing harm to individuals and waste for health systems.”

As such, the group is calling for governments to pass legislation requiring disclosure when medical reviewers are paid by the manufacturers. In addition, they bring attention to countries like Norway that have moved away from acknowledging physicians’ attendance at industry-sponsored events, when it comes to earning continuing educational credits.

The idea that industry-funded studies affect medical decisions is not news.9 The number of clinical studies supported by companies that make a profit from the results is only growing. One example is Johnson & Johnson, the company that sold pelvic mesh to thousands of Australian women while knowing it could be harmful and without warning the women or physicians of the risks.

More than 1,350 women from Australia won a class-action suit in November 2019 against Johnson & Johnson for misleading information about the risks of the pelvic mesh implants. The implants were sold by a subsidiary, Ethicon, which is charged with being negligent.

In addition to the Australian suit, Johnson & Johnson agreed to a $117 million settlement to resolve lawsuits about the pelvic mesh implants in 41 U.S. states. The same company was ordered to pay Oklahoma in a judgment in which the state argued Johnson & Johnson was a “kingpin” in the opioid crisis.

Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter specifically identified two subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson that provided the majority of the raw opium used by Johnson & Johnson and other manufacturers to produce the drugs for the past two decades.10

The women who had the pelvic mesh implanted for treatment of urinary incontinence testified to chronic pain, severe discomfort and bleeding during sex after having the implant. In the ruling against Johnson & Johnson in Australia, judge Anna Katzmann said:11

“The question is whether this conduct considered as a whole was misleading or likely to mislead. I believe it was. The post-market evaluation of all the Ethicon devices was deficient. It fell well below the level of care required of a reasonably prudent manufacturer. The risks were known, not insignificant and on Ethicon’s own admission, serious harm could ensue if they eventuated.”

The history of the relationship between physicians and pharmaceutical companies began in the early 1900s when the Carnegie Foundation contributed to the suppression of homeopathic practitioners.

The infamous Flexner Report gave homeopathic colleges a poor rating based in part on the school offering courses in pharmacology, which the American Medical Association did not consider worthwhile at the time.

Over time, the AMA and Big Pharma came to an understanding and relationship that has linked them ever since. While it may have seemed a logical step in the beginning, it has proven to be disastrous for The BMJ1 suggested a strong conflict of interest when they wrote about a revolving door existing between the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry.health.

For instance,12 from 2011 to 2015, the pharmaceutical industry dropped more than $286 million on events attended by Australian clinicians. Some received free travel and lodging for overseas conferences.

This increases the likelihood a practitioner will prescribe the company’s drugs. Although doctors have disputed this, a ProPublica analysis13 found doctors prescribed more drugs after receiving payments. The analysis shows an association and confirms the prevailing perception of a relationship between financial gifts and brand-name prescriptions.

In the wake of a call for transparency and independence from industry-funded research from the BMJ, Dr. Chris Moy, chair of the Australian Medical Association ethics and medico-legal committee voiced concern this may lead to a lack of funding.14

“Who is going to fund all this? Is the government going to fund it? Money makes the world go round, in simple terms. Research will not happen unless there is funding. Medicine is always going to need pharma companies. We cannot be too brutal on them.”

The Tale of Two Journals: NEJM Partners With Big Pharma

As the BMJ fights for transparency to protect consumer health, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) appears to have taken the opposite tack. In 2015, there appeared three articles written by the same author, Dr. Lisa Rosenbaum,15,16,17 in which the journal appeared to shift its support in favor of closer ties between the pharmaceutical industry and the field of medicine.

February 7, 2019, the journal published two industry-funded studies examining omadacycline as an antibiotic for treatment in community-acquired pneumonia18 or soft tissue infection.19 In a description of the methods and analysis in the study on soft tissue infection, the authors wrote of Paratek, manufacturer of omadacycline:20

“Paratek Pharmaceuticals designed and conducted the trial and prepared the statistical analysis plan. Analyses were performed and data interpreted by Paratek Pharmaceuticals in conjunction with the authors.”

The study used a noninferiority trial design21 in which an experimental treatment is tested against an active control and approved treatment in use. Noninferiority trials are used when assigning patients to a placebo is unethical. One analysis of the studies came to this conclusion:22

“It is fairly evident that this article was not intended to further scientific progress, but rather to sell a shiny new product … And while by all accounts this novel antimicrobial appears to be non-inferior and likely equivalent to moxiflaxacin, it is the intention and the methodology which we should call into question.”

Further analysis of two more studies published on the same date revealed more holes in the studies, bending the results toward prescribing medications that were likely as effective as those currently being sold. The analysis finished with this conclusion:23

“While each of these articles offer their own distinct set of insults against empiricism, they do so in close temporal and spatial proximity, all published in the NEJM on the same day.”

C05917,08/12/2019,conspiracy,"A top medical journal is driving a global campaign to separate medicine from big pharma, connecting industry influence to the pelvic mesh scandal that injured hundreds of women.

The BMJ says doctors are excessively influenced by industry-funded trials for major drugs and industry-sponsored education events.

The journal’s editor and a team of global healthcare leaders write in a scathing editorial published on Wednesday that those trials cannot be trusted. They write:

“(the) endemic financial entanglement with industry is distorting the production and use of healthcare evidence, causing harm to individuals and waste for health systems.”

They are asking governments to start funding independent trials of new drugs and medical devices, instead of relying on industry-funded studies. Studies show that sponsored research is more likely to find a favourable result compared to independent research. And they also want medical associations to dissuade doctors from going to industry-funded education events.

Assistant Professor Ray Moynihan is one of the leaders of The BMJ’s campaign. Moynihan is a Bond University researcher studying the link between money and medicine. He says:

“When we want to decide on a medicine or a surgery, a lot of the evidence we used to inform that decision is biased. It cannot be trusted. Because so much of that has been produced and funded by the manufacturers of those healthcare products.“

Dr. Moynihan points to the example of medical giant Johnson & Johnson, which sold their pelvic mesh to thousands of Australian women. The company knew the mesh could cause serious harm, but never adequately warned women of the risks.

A US court found that the same company, Johnson & Johnson, intentionally played down the dangers and oversold the benefits of opioids, stoking the addiction crisis that claims the lives of 130 Americans a day. The company plans to appeal in both cases.

The BMJ also wants policies in place to stop doctors from receiving professional development points for attending industry-sponsored education events. Critics claim that these educational events are thinly disguised sales seminars.

According to University of Sydney research, pharma companies spent more than $286 million between 2011 and 2015 on events for Australian doctors, nurses, pharmacists. Most received free food and beverages, and some got complimentary flights and accommodation for an overseas conference.

Studies prove that doctors who attend industry-sponsored events are more likely to prescribe the company’s drugs.

But the Australian Medical Association questions how medical education and research would be funded if the pharmaceutical industry was not involved. Dr. Chris Moy, chair of the association’s ethics and medico-legal committee says:

“Who is going to fund all this? Is the government going to fund it? Money makes the world go round, in simple terms. Research will not happen unlhttps://www.smh.com.au/national/cannot-be-trusted-causing-harm-top-medical-journal-takes-on-big-pharma-20191203-p53ggj.htmless there is funding. Medicine is always going to need pharma companies. We cannot be too brutal on them.”

The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons says it requires its members not to accept money or gifts in exchange for using certain devices or surgeries. They also must declare any conflicts of interest – for example, if they are on a company’s payroll – to their patients.

The Medical Technology Association of Australia says its members are bound by a “code of practice which aims to ensure that healthcare providers are not influenced in their decision-making through financial or other inducements to choose one device over another”.

Medicines Australia, which represents major pharmaceutical companies, did not return a request for comment.

You should definitely wear a mask to help stop the spread of the virus, but masks don’t really offer any protection and could in fact make matters worse.

The virus will kill potentially hundreds of millions of people, but it’s actually not that deadly and most will not even know they have anything more than a cold.

Fortunately, your children are safe, with just a handful of cases in under 9’s you do not need to worry about your children, but doctors are worried over children coming down with coronavirus-linked syndrome. However, the Coronavirus-linked syndrome has no known link to Coronavirus, so don’t worry.

The good thing is, once you have had the virus or when it arrives, the vaccine, you will be immune, though you may not be immune and in fact some scientists are concerned that you cannot become immune from this virus, but you should get the vaccine when one comes available.

If you are left feeling confused by the ongoing coronavirus theatre, it worked. That’s exactly how you are supposed to feel, confused, uncertain, fearful and anxious.

A confused population is a very malleable population, when the mind is left in a state of confusion, it is open to accept advice or an order far more easily.

The following is an excerpt from ‘Mind Control Language Patterns’ by Dantalion Jones[1]:

World leaders to the most part are as confused as the public are, they have quite literally no clue what they are doing, why they are doing it and what the outcome will be. The driving force behind this is coming from hidden hands within multiple organisations and institutions, each with their own part to play in directing the global society according to their own agenda.

If that sounds too far-fetched for you, then maybe you have not been paying attention.

Just to remind you, much of the World has been under house-arrest for the last three months, global travel for the average person has been halted until further notice. Tracking apps and new mobile sharing agreements are now in place to monitor social contact, you are not allowed to hug people outside of your legal residence. Is that not enough to make you wonder at the very least if something far bigger is going on behind the theatre?

Let’s not forget, the majority of the World has not experienced a mortality rate this season beyond the usual average, and those that have are not significantly higher than a bad influenza season. The simplest question which I have asked since day one of this ridiculous Lockdown was ‘What is the significant difference with this alleged viral threat compared to all those that came before?’ – No one can answer it, and why? Well, because there is no valid answer, there is no significant difference between COVID19 and H1N1 or SARS, well other than the fact that the latter two were far more deadly.

While I may not have the answers to all the questions surrounding this fiasco, one piece of advice I do have is this, stop being confused. Forget about what the media is saying, or what your bumbling idiot in Government is bleating, it’s all noise, it’s all irrelevant mumbo-jumbo designed to keep everyone in a state of confusion. Just either ignore, or as I love to do – laugh at it and where possible point out these clowns for the clowns that they most certainly are.

A nefarious conspiratorial agenda designed to enslave humanity can only work if we allow it. Believe it or not, you have a choice."

I recently got my slots shifted about though, they appear to have some new algorithm which seems to have switched who gets priority for the earlier time slots as my app is now telling me that 7.15pm is my access time for the supermarket. Only 30 minutes later than before I suppose, so I can’t really complain.

One good thing, I can walk to the shop this week, apparently there is a window of time between 6.30pm and 9.00pm which will see the east park area, the back way to the shops quiet – seems no one reserved the ‘rite of passage’ this week – lucky me, I think.

I’m just hoping work pays me this week, I realised late last night that I hadn’t logged on at all for the whole day, I did the work, it’s just they changed the system and muggins here forgot to use the new system. Sarah did say she’d lend me the cash, but she’s back in quarantine for the 4th time in as many months.

Damn fucking viruses, just finished watching China’s second wave this year, seems worse than the last. One video literally had people falling down like pins in a bowling alley, kind of puts things into perspective – I moan, sometimes it’s hard, but when you look at the alternative, well, we’ve got it pretty good.

Welcome to the ‘New Normal’

We keep hearing about the ‘New Normal’, we hear it from every government mouthpiece around the World, we hear how ‘things will probably never go back to how they were’, why is that? What’s changed? Oh, the virus, the COVID19 that’s wiping out civilisation as I write, or not as the case seems to be.

I don’t care what you think about the situation, whether you think it is indeed some nasty strain of coronavirus as we are being told or whether you think it’s a big fat hoax to con the World out of its basic freedoms with a whole host of other benefits to boot, regardless of any of this, the numbers, even if doubled, tripled, or quadrupled do not justify an entire shift in how we function as a society.

The lunatics preaching this continual stream of ridiculous claptrappery (second time I’ve used my newly invented word) are just lunatics, control freaks and psychopaths; so for them, the idea of limiting basic freedoms for entire societies is, of course, a natural progression to how things should be, we should be locked up, scared and only allowed out on good behaviour – psychopath logic 101.

The general population however, what on earth are they playing at, you don’t get to take this back. Freedom is often taken away, but rarely given back, that requires a revolution and judging by how so many seem to be quite happy to do as they are told, like good scared dependable little citizens, I don’t think we can rely on a revolution from those guys.

Lets just make it a little clearer, just to help those who are not quite up with the latest cool stuff they are planning to put into place to save you from, errrrm, something.

That’s right, get your very own trendy bracelet. But this isn’t just any old bracelet, no sir-ree, this is a state-of-the art (probably made in China) tracking bracelet. By tracking entire populations and updating who is infected and who isn’t infected, you can be sure of your safety at all times. If bracelets are not your thing, don’t worry, they’ve got that covered, a smart phone app can be used instead.

But that’s not it, this is the gift that just keeps on giving. Not only can you be warned, and ensure others are warned about potential COVID19 infected individuals, it can also ensure social distancing can be optimized and enforced. If your proximity is getting too close to another fellow human, well it can warn you. Just a friendly little tinkle, or vibrate and a signal back to your local government and you can correct the error of your ways.

This is brilliant, and why wouldn’t it be, when Bill Gates is behind it you just know it’s going to be awesome, just like Windows Vista, right. Ok, that kinda sucked, but this won’t, just imagine how easy life will become with a DigitalID. No longer will you have to remember your passport, it’ll be half an inch under your skin! Awesome, right.

While these may start off in some form of tattoo based RFID technology, the implant does seem to be the favourite way to go. But it’s not just convenience that makes these new passports so awesome, just think of all the other data you could attach to it.

For one, we can make sure those dirty anti-vaxxers are stopped before they attempt to go into public confined spaces, whether that be an airplane or just your local cinema, with a simple RFID chip, it takes no time to root these folk out and where necessary prosecute.

That’s just the tip of the iceberg, there are a whole host of fun little freedom grabbing things that can be done with these digitialIDs. Hats off to Gates and Co., who needs freedom anyway, that’s what I say."

C06d3e,23/12/2015,conspiracy,"Ministers in the United Kingdom recently announced that the National Health Service could ban doctors from prescribing homeopathic remedies. The announcement is a culmination of several years of campaigning by members of parliament who say that the health claims of homeopathy are unproven, their use is a waste of taxpayer money and these remedies should not be supported by the nation’s publicly funded healthcare system.

The NHS could be spending around £5 million ($7.45 million) each year on homeopathic remedies, according to a report by Good Thinking Society, a charity that campaigns against NHS funding for homeopathy. Samuel Osborne of the Independent writes that the money the NHS currently spends on homeopathy “could fund 239 fully qualified nurses a year,” noting that homeopathy “has been extensively studied and conclusively debunked.”

“Given the finite resources of the NHS, any spending on homeopathy is utterly unjustifiable,” said GTS founder Simon Singh. “The money spent on these disproven remedies can be far better spent on treatments that offer real benefits to patients.” Prescriptions issued by general practitioners account for about £110,000 ($164,000) each year, according to the BBC.

The proposed ban is sure to have a good number of detractors: Each year, nearly six million Britons see practitioners of “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM) — which includes homeopathy — with one in four wanting access to be universally available through the NHS.

Prince Charles certainly can’t be pleased. Like many royal family members, he is a devoted homeopath who credited the practice with helping him heal abroken arm.

Conceived of in 1796 by German physician Samuel Christian Hahnemann, homeopathy is an alternative practice of medicine based on the concept of “likes cure likes” (Hahnemann called it the “law of similars”). Homeopaths believe an extremely diluted version of an illness-causing substance can cure that illness. A homeopath may treat hay fever, for example, by administering a dilution of grass or pollen.

Homeopathy is a thriving industry not just in the U.K., but around the globe. The European market has grown 60 percent over a decade. According to the latest estimates from the Centers for Disease Control, about 3.3 million Americans spent $2.9 billion on homeopathic remedies in 2007.

The practice enjoys its biggest popularity in India, where it is officially recognized by the government as one of its national systems of medicine, and regulated by the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. India is home to the largest number of homeopathic practitioners in the world and has the most colleges in homeopathic education.

While India remains a homeopathy stronghold, other national governments have come out strongly against it. In addition to the recent moves by the U.K. Parliament, Australia’s top body for medical research, the National Health and Medical Research Council, came out against homeopathy with a report issued earlier this year. “Based on the assessment of the evidence of effectiveness of homeopathy, NHMRC concludes that there are no health conditions for which there is reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective,” the council wrote. It added a stern warning: “People who choose homeopathy may put their health at risk if they reject or delay treatments for which there is good evidence for safety and effectiveness.”

”We need governments around the world to recognize the dangers of promoting homeopathy for life-threatening illnesses,” said Robert Hagan, a biomolecular scientist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Hagan is a member of the Voice of Young Science Network, a group of young researchers concerned that the use and promotion of homeopathy in the developing world is putting lives at risk. The group is part of Sense About Science, a charity that educates the public about evidence-based science. In 2009, VYSN sent a letter to the World Health Organization urging the body to issue a statement condeming the promotion of homeopathy for the treatment of serious diseases.

WHO responded with a warning that people with serious conditions such as HIV, tuberculosis and malaria should not rely on homeopathic treatments.

Paula Ross, chief executive of the Society of Homeopaths, agreed with the concerns about promoting homeopathy remedies for TB, malaria or HIV and AIDS. But she said, “This is just another poorly wrapped attempt to discredit homeopathy by Sense About Science.”

“The irony is that in their efforts to promote evidence in medicine, they have failed to do their own homework,” said Ross. “There is a strong and growing evidence base for homeopathy and most notably, this also includes childhood diarrhea.”

Sara Eames, president of the U.K.’s Faculty of Homeopathy, said it “seems reasonable to consider what beneficial role homeopathy could play” as possible treatments for serious disease. “What is needed is further research and investment into homeopathy.”

The British government disagrees with Eames’ assessment. The U.K.’s announcement of the possible national ban, made in November, comes nearly six years after the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee published a damning 2010 report that said homeopathic remedies performed no better than placebos, adding that the practice was based on principles that are “scientifically implausible.”

The report came on the heels of an editorial published in the Journal of Medical Ethics by David Martin Shaw of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Glasgow. In it, he outlined five potential unethical effects of homeopathy:
• Patients may seek homeopathic remedies instead of, rather than as well as, traditional medicine
• It is ethically dubious to spend NHS funds on treatment that has no evidence base
• Homeopathy can involve deceiving the patient; indeed, if the only effect is placebo, it is probable that deception is essential to the practice of homeopathy
• Support for homeopathy could weaken patient confidence in the NHS, and in science and medicine more generally
• Funding homeopathy distracts attention from the fact that there are other complementary therapies that are efficacious

There is another ethical issue: In the U.K., there is no legal regulation of homeopathic practitioners. “This means that anyone can practice as a homeopath, even if they have no qualifications or experience,” notes the NHS.

The NHS website lists several common conditions that are commonly treated with homeopathy, including asthma, high blood pressure, ear infections, hay fever, allergies, dermatitis, arthritis and mental health conditions, such as depression, stress and anxiety.

“There is no good quality evidence that homeopathy is an effective treatment for these or any other health conditions,” says the NHS. “Some practitioners also claim that homeopathy can prevent malaria or other diseases. There is no evidence to support this and no scientifically plausible way that homeopathy can prevent diseases.”

Sense About Science has been monitoring public perceptions of homeopathy. In its written submission to the parliamentary report, it said homeopathic remedies are “often confused with herbal medicine (and, related to this, that people were oftenunaware of the mystical belief in water memory and in ‘like cures like’ on which it is based).”

Importantly, they said people assumed that because a homeopathic remedy is supplied by the NHS, it “must be effective” and “there must be something in it.”

But there’s another, more pressing issue that has brought this possible ban to the foreground: the national budget. In an interview last year, U.K. health secretary Jeremy Hunt, responding to a question about spending on homeopathy, said, “When resources are tight, we have to follow the scientific evidence and spend the NHS’s money on what works.”

CRISPR technology is relatively new, however, it has been around for some time in some form. Scientists have also edited Chickens to have genes added to code for IFNalpha2a, a human protein with anticancer and antiviral effects, and macrophage-CSF, a protein that helps produce white blood cells.

The experiments to try and produce an “edible” malaria vaccine, with the ultimate goal being that children drinking the milk would become vaccinated in the process.

Researchers have also used CRISPR technology and other gene-editing technologies to create cows that can tolerate warmer temperatures, goats with longer cashmere wool and rabbits and pigs with bigger, leaner muscles. But you’ll never guess what, there were side effects.

Enlarged tongues in the rabbits.8 Among pigs that were altered by deleting the myostatin (MSTN) gene, which limits muscle growth, the larger muscles came along with an extra vertebrate in 20 percent of the gene-edited animals.

Researchers at the U.K.’s Wellcome Sanger Institute systematically studied mutations from CRISPR-Cas9 in mouse and human cells, large genetic rearrangements were observed, including DNA deletions and insertions, near the target site.

The DNA deletions could end up activating genes that should stay “off,” such as cancer-causing genes, as well as silencing those that should be “on."

In the days of World War II and Nazi Germany Bayer was known as IG Farben.

The following is taken from Warhistoryonline.com, it clearly explains the dark history behind now named Pharmaceutical giant Bayer:

Auschwitz was much more than a concentration camp. It was also the setting for IG Auschwitz, a 100 percent subsidiary of IG Farben. It was the largest complex in the world manufacturing gasoline and rubber.

It was also where IG Farben tested its products. Prisoners who were considered appropriate candidates were sent to the IG Auschwitz factory. There they were used for human experiments of new vaccines being developed. The unlucky individuals sent to the gas chambers were privy to another kind of IG Farben invention – the synthetic gas Zyklon-B.

The IG Auschwitz factory was not the only place where human testing was being conducted on victims. IG Farben had its own concentration camp. There, tested vaccines and chemicals were applied to both sick and healthy individuals, in the form of injections, pills, enemas and powders. Many fell seriously ill or died as a result of these tests.

Bayer bought many of these prisoners from the Auschwitz camp. Letters have been found written between the two organisations regarding the buying of 150 inmates, who were to be used for the testing of a new sleeping pill. The women were bought at 170 RM (Reichsmark) each, and records show they were in a satisfactory condition, despite being emaciated.

Later, follow-up messages indicate all prisoners died, and they required to buy a further shipment.

An Auschwitz resident testimonial states there was a large ward where all tuberculous patients were kept. Bayer sent unmarked medicines to this ward. These were injected into the test subjects, causing them all to die.

IG Farben’s other branches dealing with pharmaceuticals conducted experiments too, including typhus fever. They were not successful. It was decided the tests were invalid, as the subjects tested were in poor condition, and the laboratories provided were not ideal.

This total disregard for human life is typical of the Pharmaceutical Industry. GlaxoSmithKline, another one of the big players in the Pharmaceutical Industry have been accused of performing secret trials on children in Irish state-run homes between 1930 – 1936:

The trials, which were for a diphtheria vaccine, were conducted before the vaccine was made available for used in the UK.

After spending three years sorting through more than 25,000 medical journals Mr Dwyer found data in only six reports, but from these he was able to establish that 2,051 children and babies in residential care homes had been vaccinated.

The trials were held between 1930 and 1936.

Children in Bessborough, Co Cork and Sean Ross Abby in Roscrea, Co Tipperary were secretly tested.

“What I have found is just the tip of a very large and submerged iceberg” Mr Dwyer told The Mail.

Bayer were not the only Company to assist in the Holocaust, Abby Martin tells us the other major Corporations which are responsible for these atrocities:"
C05953,04/07/2019,conspiracy,"The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has repeatedly asked CDC to create studies which explain, “How do child health outcomes compare between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated children?”

During a November 2012 Congressional hearing on autism before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Dr. Coleen Boyle, the Director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, gave evasive answers to lawmakers pressing her on this point. After considerable badgering, she finally stated, “We have not studied vaccinated versus unvaccinated [children].” That was perjury.Verstraeten found a dramatic link between mercury-containing hepatitis B vaccines and several neurological injuries including autism and prepared the study for publication.

Boyle knew that CDC had commissioned an in-house researcher, Thomas Verstraeten to perform vaccinated/unvaccinated study on CDC’s giant Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) in 1999 (I summarize Verstraeten’s secret findings on slide 2). Verstraeten found a dramatic link between mercury-containing hepatitis B vaccines and several neurological injuries including autism and prepared the study for publication. CDC shared Verstraeten’s analysis with the then four vaccine makers but kept it secret from the American public.

The world’s largest vaccine maker GSK whisked Verstraeten off to a sinecure in Brussels and CDC handed his raw data to his CDC boss Frank DeStefano and another researcher, Robert Davis who served as a vaccine industry consultant. Those two men tortured the data for 4 years, removing all unvaccinated children, to bury the autism signal before publishing a sanitized version purporting to exculpate the vaccine. The CDC then cut off public access to the VSD and to this day aggressively blocks any attempts by researchers to study health outcomes in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations.

Despite CDC’s efforts at suppression, independent scientists and research institutions (including UCLA) have managed to conduct and publish several additional vaccinated/unvaccinated studies since 1999. Those studies indicate high incidence of chronic diseases and brain and immune system injuries among vaccinated compared to unvaccinated cohorts. I summarize some of these reports in the following slides. (See full-sized slides)"

C02c84,20/02/2019,conspiracy,"Andrew Wakefield has found his name back in the public eye once again, after a renewed interest in the debate began three years ago with Wakefield’s controversial film ‘Vaxxed’. The film was axed from the Tribeca Film festival following outside pressure on the organisers. Now more recently, his name is circulating due to the multiple outbreaks of measles from around the World and the growing war on ‘Anti-Vaxxers’.

But what is the truth surrounding the MMR – Autism link that Andrew Wakefield allegedly found?

Wikipedia is a good starting point to find the officially accepted narrative on any subject, here is the ‘Andrew Wakefield’ entry:

Andrew Jeremy Wakefield (born 1957) is a British former gastroenterologist and medical researcher, known for his fraudulent 1998 research paper in support of the now-discredited claim that there was a link between the administration of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and the appearance of autism and bowel disease.

After the publication of the paper, other researchers were unable to reproduce Wakefield’s findings or confirm his hypothesis of an association between the MMR vaccine and autism, or autism and gastrointestinal disease. A 2004 investigation by Sunday Times reporter Brian Deer identified undisclosed financial conflicts of interest on Wakefield’s part, and most of his co-authors then withdrew their support for the study’s interpretations.

The British General Medical Council (GMC) conducted an inquiry into allegations of misconduct against Wakefield and two former colleagues. The investigation centred on Deer’s numerous findings, including that children with autism were subjected to unnecessary invasive medical procedures such as colonoscopies and lumbar punctures,[11] and that Wakefield acted without the required ethical approval from an institutional review board. [read more]

So the mainstream belief is that Andrew Wakefield fraudulently performed studies and published his paper purely for personal gain.

You can find all of Brian Deer’s investigation material on this subject his website at briandeer.com

So who is Brian Deer ?

Brian Deer is the reporter who savaged Dr Wakefield from the pages of the Sunday Times, a paper managed by Rupert Murdoch’s son James Murdoch who is on the board of GlaxoSmithKline which makes the MMR. Deer researched his case with the help of Medico-Legal Investigations, a private enquiry company whose only source of funding is the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.

Deer was both the journalist writing on Wakefield and the person who brought a case of fitness to practice medicine to the General Medical Council, and then wrote about the proceedings as well. [read more]

The timing of Deer‘s first letter of complaint to the GMC of 25th February 2004 shows Deer wasted no time after the publication of his Sunday 22rd February 2004 Sunday Times stories against Wakefield. Before a single word had been written by him, Deer had consulted with, and been given free advice and assistance by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry company Medico-Legal Investigations Limited, whose speciality was getting doctors on charges before the GMC.

Here is journalist Jane Bryant discussing her interview with Brian Deer outside the GMC hearing in 2008:

When asked if Deer was the complainant and if this was his case with the GMC, Deer simply exploded. Springing to his feet, placing his body inches from mine and invading my space, Deer proceeded to threaten, to rant and to jab his fingers close to my face.

Brian Deer: “No! I’ve not complained! I’ve got letters from the GMC saying I’m not the complainant! Ask me the question again! Ask me and I’ll tell you!”

“Deer was also not working alone. Deer was working hand-in-hand with Dr. Evan Harris a British Member of Parliament, Glaxo-Wellcome fellow and active Member of the British Medical Association and Harris even at that early stage attended with Deer at the offices of The Lancet, as Lancet Editor Dr Horton recorded later in his book, on these events [“MMR Science and Fiction: Exploring the Vaccine Crisis,”]. This was also confirmed by Harris indirectly in Parliament and later by the public attendance by him with Deer at the GMC hearings against Wakefield in London, England.”

On the 28 May 2010 Brian Deer made the following statement on the BMJ website distancing himself from Dr. Evan Harris and played down his part in the investigation:

Most importantly, it’s misleading for Dr Harris to say that he “assisted” that investigation. For me, Dr Harris was a routine journalistic contact who supplied a number of quotes for stories, and one document – a letter sent to him by Wakefield’s lawyers.

At his own initiative, Dr Harris observed a meeting between myself and the senior editors of the Lancet, in February 2004, but he misspeaks when he claims that “we” explained to the editor Dr Richard Horton what “lay behind” the now-retracted Wakefield paper of February 1998.

Although unexpected, Dr. Harris’s presence at the meeting was welcome to me, since, as an investigative journalist dealing in matters of reputation, I like to have independent witnesses to my conduct and demeanour. However, the material presented was entirely my own. [Read more]

Dr. Evan Harris has likewise tried to distance himself from Brian Deer since the investigation [Read More]

It’s also worth noting that Deer was hired to investigate Wakefield by Sunday Times editor Paul Nuki, who is the son of Prof George Nuki, who was on the Commitee on Safety of Medicines when MMR and Pluserix were introduced.

So What Did Wakefield’s Study Actually Conclude?

At “Ignite the Truth” event in Dana Point, California , Dr. Wakefield cleared up some major misconceptions about his famous paper, including the lie that it declared all vaccines to cause autism. He had this to say concerning the structure and intent of his greatly misunderstood research:

“No one has read this paper. No one actually knows what it says. This is a case series. This is the way human disease syndromes are described, whether it’s Asperger’s syndrome or Crohn’s disease or multiple sclerosis — a handful of patients that present with a similar pattern of signs and symptoms that merit investigation and reporting in their own right.”

Concerning what his paper supposedly declared, Dr. Wakefield had this to add:

“It doesn’t test any hypothesis. It’s not intended to. It can’t. All it can do is generate hypothesis of causation — what is based upon, in this case, the parents’ story. What did this mother, sitting across the desk from me in clinic, say happened to her child? That is where medicine begins. It doesn’t begin in a laboratory, it doesn’t begin with a test — it begins with a clinical history.”

Wakefields full retracted study can be found on The Lancet website here – This following statement is the closest the paper gets to linking the MMR to Autism.

We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.

Wakefield merely suggested further investigations should be performed to determine if there is indeed a link between the vaccine and chronic enterocolitis, a suggestion which on any other topic other than vaccines would be deemed a responsible one.

Andrew Wakefield continues to defend himself while at the ‘Ignite the Truth’ event:

“I was accused of performing colonoscopies on these children, doing lumbar punctures — I never investigated these children. I was responsible for bringing this team together and conducting the investigation of these children. I was not responsible for their clinical care — that was performed by an outstanding group of gastroenterologists who confirmed, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that these children have an inflammatory bowel disease and that has now been replicated around the world.”

You can watch Wakefield’s full speech below:

A team from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina are examining 275 children with regressive autism and bowel disease – and of the 82 tested so far, 70 prove positive for the measles virus.

Team leader of the study Dr. Stephen Walker stated back in 2006:

‘This research proves that in the gastrointestinal tract of a number of children who have been diagnosed with regressive autism, there is evidence of measles virus. What it means is that the study done earlier by Dr Wakefield and published in 1998 is correct. That study didn’t draw any conclusions about specifically what it means to find measles virus in the gut, but the implication is it may be coming from the MMR vaccine. If that’s the case, and this live virus is residing in the gastrointestinal tract of some children, and then they have GI inflammation and other problems, it may be related to the MMR.’

Developmental Regression and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in a Child With Autism

‘If such dysfunction is present at the time of infections and immunizations in young children, the added oxidative stresses from immune activation on cellular energy metabolism are likely to be especially critical for the central nervous system, which is highly dependent on mitochondrial function. Young children who have dysfunctional cellular energy metabolism therefore might be more prone to undergo autistic regression between 18 and 30 months of age if they also have infections or immunizations at the same time.’

‘The association between hepatitis B vaccination of male neonates and parental report of autism diagnosis was determined. This cross-sectional study used weighted probability samples obtained from National Health Interview Survey 1997-2002 data sets.’

There are many more studies suggesting possible links between Vaccines and Autism, Autism and Gut disorders.

“… it’s been replicated in Canada, in the U.S., in Venezuela, in Italy… [but] they never get mentioned. All you ever hear is that no one else has ever been able to replicate the findings. I’m afraid that is false.” – Andrew Wakefield

Dr Peter Fletcher, who was Chief Scientific Officer at the Department of Health, said if it is proven that the jab causes autism, “the refusal by governments to evaluate the risks properly will make this one of the greatest scandals in medical history”.

He added that after agreeing to be an expert witness on drug-safety trials for parents’ lawyers, he had received and studied thousands of documents relating to the case which he believed the public had a right to see.

He said he has seen a “steady accumulation of evidence” from scientists worldwide that the measles, mumps and rubella jab is causing brain damage in certain children.

But he added: “There are very powerful people in positions of great authority in Britain and elsewhere who have staked their reputations and careers on the safety of MMR and they are willing to do almost anything to protect themselves.”

So from everything we know is it fair to say that Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s studies are 100% fraudulent as proclaimed by the mainstream media, or is it possible that regardless of whether his findings hold truth or not Andrew Wakefield had to be discredited to protect the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical industry?

So is it not reasonable to say if we are to be expected to question Andrew Wakefield’s claims then we should also be questioning the industry that condemned him, right?

Andrew Wakefield has made the headlines again with his new documentary ‘Vaxxed’ . The documentary was due to be shown at Robert De Niro’s prestigious Tribeca Film festival but in the last week, the decision was made to remove it from the festival. Robert De Niro initially defended his decision to premier the Documentary at the festival and made the following statement:

‘Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined. …this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening VAXXED. I am not personally endorsing the film, nor am I anti-vaccination; I am only providing the opportunity for a conversation around the issue.’

Soon after this statement was made the film was pulled from the festival and a further statement was made by De Niro:

‘We do not believe it contributes to or furthers the discussion I had hoped for’

The sudden retraction of his initial decision is not known however it came shortly after the media became outraged with his initial statement, as John Rappoport stated:

‘He’s been taught a lesson. Don’t go up against the medical cartel. Keep your mouth shut.’

Finally, there is the CDC Whistleblower story which suggests that the CDC covered up links between the MMR and Autism.

In a press release issued last year, one that almost no mainstream media sources have bothered to report, it was announced that Dr. Brian Hooker had finally received documents from the CDC through a Freedom of Information Act that revealed the CDC had access to data linking Thimerosal in vaccines to autism, non-organic sleep disorders, and speech disorders.

Two members of Congress helped Dr Hooker draft his letter to the CDC, after having spent nearly 10 years submitting over 100 Freedom of Information Acts to no avail.

This information was completely blacked out of the mainstream media.

This information is very damaging to the CDC, which has stated for years that there are no studies linking the mercury of Thimerosal in vaccines to autism.

Dr Brian Hooker received a phone call from Dr William Thompson of the CDC, one of the original authors of the 2004 study. A series of phone calls took place, and Dr. Hooker recorded some of them. Here is the now famous video that was released in the summer of 2014 that mainstream media basically ignored:

While most of the mainstream media has been ignoring this story, independent journalist and former CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson called Dr. Frank DeStefano, the CDC Director of Immunization Safety, who was a co-author with Dr. William Thompson in the 2004 CDC study on the MMR vaccine, and asked him some questions about the concealed data Dr. Thompson had revealed.

She recorded her phone call and posted it on her website here.

Attkisson asked the CDC director why the excluded data linking the measles vaccine to autism in African American boys would not be important enough to investigate further since it contained such a higher rate of autism. Dr. DeStefano’s reply was very typical of the bias that currently exists among CDC scientists when it comes to autism:

…you know, autism, as you probably are aware, is a condition that really probably has its start while the child is still in the womb. And, you now, it doesn’t, some of the behaviors and such don’t come apparent, become apparent until maybe the child is one, two, three years old.

In other words, they believe autism is completely due to genetic factors, and not environmental factors. Of course, this theory of the genetic cause of autism lends itself to billions of dollars in drug research, even though it contradicts the scientific evidence, as well as the experience of many tens of thousands of parents who saw their completely normal child rapidly digress within hours of immunisation.

Even the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has paid out damages to children with autism as a result of vaccines, including the measles MMR vaccine. [Read More]

C04fd3,20/04/2019,conspiracy,"The New York City Board of Health voted Wednesday to extend a public health emergency action in parts of Brooklyn where several cases of Measles have been reported – the vote was unanimous.

The mandate, which was implemented last week, ordered that all residents in the neighbourhood of Williamsburg over the age of 6 months get vaccinated for the disease or face a fine of up to $1,000. Non-compliance could result in a prison sentence.

This so-called health emergency has occurred because there have allegedly been 300 cases of Measles reported since last October, leaving some rather mystified to the panic that is being generated by health officials and the mainstream media.

C00646,26/10/2015,conspiracy,"Former UK PM Tony Blair should be indicted by the International Criminal Court for leading Britain into an illegal war with Iraq, resulting in millions of deaths and the rise of Islamic State, says Neil Clark, a journalist and a broadcaster.

The former British Prime Minister admitted in an interview with CNN that there are “elements of truth” to the supposition that the US-led Iraq invasion led to the rise of Islamic State.

“I find it hard to apologize for removing Saddam. I think, even from today in 2015, it is better that he’s not there than that he is there,” Blair told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria.

RT: Could you shed some light as to why this is happening now? Is there something in the timing that has prompted Tony Blair to admit the failures of the 2003 campaign?

Neil Clark: I woke up this morning to the rather dramatic headline that Tony Blair had “apologized for the Iraq war.” I thought: what’s happening here? Of course, when I actually looked at the story more closely, he hasn’t done anything of the sort, he hasn’t apologized at all…He said “there were elements of truth” in the idea that the Iraqi invasion may have led to the rise of ISIS…In fact, without the Iraq war, we wouldn’t have the Islamic State today, would we? I think this is really more spin from this warmonger, it’s an attempt to justify the Iraq war rather than being an apology…He said that he finds it very hard to apologize for removing Saddam Hussein from power. Of course, a regime change is illegal under international law.

I think the reason he is coming out with this now is the Chilcot report, which we are still waiting for… We had revelations last week, Colin Powell’s memo, which showed that Tony Blair committed Britain to support the Iraq war back in about 2002. And despite what had been said in public, that Saddam Hussein could have avoided war by renouncing his weapons of mass destruction, we knew that Blair had already committed Britain to that war. So, he has been caught lying and I think he is doing this now to try and spin his way out of it. Comments that he made in that interview, that Iraq could have been another Syria…That’s absolutely ludicrous because part of the reason why Syria is in such a state is because of radical Islamic terrorist groups like the Islamic State, which have been caused by the Iraq war.

RT: Blair also said that intelligence data on Saddam’s chemical program had proved wrong. How could they start an intervention based on unconfirmed data?

NC: The reason why they invaded Iraq was because Iraq didn’t have WMDs. If Blair and Bush genuinely thought Iraq had WMDs, they would not be invading it, they would be deterred. Don’t forget that people like Blair are telling us now that Britain must maintain Trident, we have to have weapons of mass destruction to deter an attack. And the very same people are telling us, want us to believe, that we invaded Iraq because Iraq had WMDs. We know quite clearly that Tony Blair and the warmongers lied to us about Iraq having WMDs, and now they are trying to blame the intelligence services. Intelligence services were under pressure to come up with ‘evidence’ that they knew the government wanted. Some of this evidence is absolutely ludicrous – taken from university students’ essays and things like this…

RT: What’s next now for Tony Blair? He has been branded a “war criminal” by some. Will this opinion strengthen now?

NC: Absolutely. The International Criminal Court, the ICC, I think has indicted 36 people so far – all of them are black Africans. They have been accused of being a racist body. Now there’s a chance for them to indict Tony Blair for war crimes. The case is absolutely crystal clear: he led Britain into an illegal war with a sovereign state on deceitful grounds… A million people have died…

… If Tony Blair isn’t put on trial for war crimes, then who else is going to be put on trial for war crimes? It really makes the whole system of international justice a farce… The ICC is indicting African leaders for crimes that are not on the same scale as Tony Blair’s crime. The Iraq war was the greatest crime of the 21st century.

C06612,28/09/2016,conspiracy,"In 2001 following the tragic events of September 11th the US began it’s ‘War on Terror’, with the first Country on the hit list being, Afghanistan.

Today, fifteen years later the US still holds a strong military presence in Afghanistan. But why ?

“The previously unknown deposits — including huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold and critical industrial metals like lithium — are so big and include so many minerals that are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed into one of the most important mining centers in the world, the United States officials believe.

An internal Pentagon memo, for example, states that Afghanistan could become the “Saudi Arabia of lithium,” a key raw material in the manufacture of batteries for laptops and BlackBerrys.

The vast scale of Afghanistan’s mineral wealth was discovered by a small team of Pentagon officials and American geologists. The Afghan government and President Hamid Karzai were recently briefed, American officials said.

While it could take many years to develop a mining industry, the potential is so great that officials and executives in the industry believe it could attract heavy investment even before mines are profitable, providing the possibility of jobs that could distract from generations of war.

“There is stunning potential here,” Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander of the United States Central Command, said… “There are a lot of ifs, of course, but I think potentially it is hugely significant.”

The value of the newly discovered mineral deposits dwarfs the size of Afghanistan’s existing war-bedraggled economy, which is based largely on opium production and narcotics trafficking as well as aid from the United States and other industrialized countries. Afghanistan’s gross domestic product is only about $12 billion.

“This will become the backbone of the Afghan economy,” said Jalil Jumriany, an adviser to the Afghan minister of mines. (New York Times, op. cit.)

In 2008 ‘The US.Energy Information Administration’ (EIA) noted that Afghanistan’s natural gas reserves are “substantial”:

“As northern Afghanistan is a ‘southward extension of Central Asia’s highly prolific, natural gas-prone Amu Darya Basin,’ Afghanistan ‘has proven, probable and possible natural gas reserves of about 5 trillion cubic feet.’ (UPI, John C.K. Daly, Analysis: Afghanistan’s untapped energy, October 24, 2008)

Afghanistan is a land bridge. The 2001 U.S. led invasion and occupation of Afghanistan has been analysed by critics of US foreign policy as a means to securing control over the strategic trans-Afghan transport corridor which links the Caspian sea basin to the Arabian sea.

Several trans-Afghan oil and gas pipeline projects have been contemplated including the planned $8.0 billion TAPI pipeline project (Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India) of 1900 km., which would transport Turkmen natural gas across Afghanistan in what is described as a “crucial transit corridor”. (See Gary Olson, Afghanistan has never been the ‘good and necessary’ war; it’s about control of oil, The Morning Call, October 1, 2009). Military escalation under the extended Af-Pak war bears a relationship to TAPI. Turkmenistan possesses third largest natural gas reserves after Russia and Iran. Strategic control over the transport routes out of Turkmenistan have been part of Washington’s agenda since the collapse of the Soviet union in 1991. [Source]

The Centre of Reseach on Globalization published a very extensive report on this topic, here are same important points from the article:

Opium production in Afghanistan skyrocketed from 185 tons to 8,200 tons between 2001 and 2007 (today it is down to 3,700 tons). Most commentary glosses over Washington’s large share of responsibility for this dramatic expansion while magnifying the Taliban’s role, which available data indicates is relatively minor. Also, identifying drugs as a main cause behind the growth of the insurgency absolves the United States and NATO of their own role in fomenting it: the very presence of foreign troops in the country as well as their destructive attacks on civilians are significant factors behind increases in popular support for, or tolerance of, the Taliban. In fact, as a recent UNODC report notes, reducing drug production would have only a “minimal impact on the insurgency’s strategic threat,” because the Taliban receive “significant funding from private donors all over the world,” a contribution that “dwarfs” drug money.

The total revenue generated by opiates within Afghanistan is about $3 billion per year. According to UNODC data, the Taliban get only about 5 percent of this sum. Farmers selling their opium harvest to traffickers get 20 percent. And the remaining 75 percent? Al-Qaeda? No: the report specifies that it “does not appear to have a direct role in the Afghan opiates trade,” although it may participate in “low-level drugs and/or arms smuggling” along the Pakistani border. Instead, the remaining 75 percent is captured by traffickers, government officials, the police, and local and regional power brokers – in short, many of the groups now supported or tolerated by the United States and NATO are important actors in the drug trade.

Mainstream commentary blames the size of the narcotics industry and much of what goes wrong in Afghanistan partly on corruption. But to focus on bad apples in the Afghan government and police misses the systemic responsibility of the United States and NATO for the dramatic expansion of opiates production since 2001 and for their support of numerous corrupt individuals in power. The United States attacked Afghanistan in association with Northern Alliance warlords and drug lords and showered them with weapons, millions of dollars, and diplomatic support.

When Donald Rumsfeld was asked in 2003 what the United States was doing about narcotics in Helmand, he replied: “You ask what we’re going to do and the answer is, I don’t really know.” A US military spokesman at Bagram base, Sergeant Major Harrison Sarles, stated: “We’re not a drug task force. That’s not part of our mission.”

Several reasons explain the early opposition to counternarcotics on the part of the White House and the military. First, Afghanistan was attacked to show that Washington should not be challenged, and destroying poppy crops and heroin labs contributes nothing in this respect.

Second, many of the United States’ local Afghan allies were involved in trafficking, from which they drew money and power. Destroying drug labs and poppy fields would have been, in effect, a direct blow to American operations and proxy fighters on the ground. As Western diplomats conceded at the time, “without money from drugs, our friendly warlords can’t pay their militias. It’s as simple as that.”

Third, the Department of Defense thought that eradicating crops would upset farmers and hurt attempts at winning Afghan hearts and minds. Indeed, since 2001, the Taliban have sought to capitalize on resentment caused by eradication schemes. For example, in Helmand “they appear to have offered protection to the farmers targeted by eradication” and in Kandahar “they were even reported to have offered financial assistance to farmers whose fields were being eradicated, in exchange for support in fighting against the government.” Thus, it is far from certain that eliminating drugs would weaken the insurgency. In fact, the opposite is more likely, as it would only add to the opposition already generated by NATO operations in the country, as noted by a well-informed analyst: “As the conflict progressed, victims of abuses by both Afghan and foreign troops and of the side-effects of US reliance on air power began to represent another important source of recruits for the Taliban.”

Afghanistan didn’t always look like it does today, in fact, Afghanistan was at the forefront of Education and Women’s Rights. It wasn’t until the Late 1970’s all this began to change.

This is not a ‘War on terror’ – This is a ‘War on morality’"
C008d6,01/06/2016,conspiracy,"Channel 4’s Cathy Newman’s full interview with Philosopher Noam Chomsky. From Trump and Clinton, to climate change, Brexit and TPP, America’s foremost intellectuals presents his views on who rules the world today.

Avram Noam Chomsky (/ˈnoʊm ˈtʃɒmski/; born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, logician, social critic, and political activist. Sometimes described as “the father of modern linguistics”, Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy, and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science.

He has spent more than half a century at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he is Institute Professor Emeritus, and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.

Noam Chomsky is from a Jewish family and hold’s some controversial views that some in the alternative scene say accredits him as an elitist new world order puppet.

In the above interview, you do get a slight sense of this with his subtle support for criminal Clinton. However; this is not to say most of what he says is not true. Anyone with half a brain already knows the USA is the biggest threat to world peace we have today.

RT reports the following: The United States is the “world’s leading terrorist state,” based on its deadly, CIA-run operations in the likes of Nicaragua and Cuba, according to new op-ed by historian and social philosopher Noam Chomsky.

In a new piece posted at Truthout.org, Chomsky pointed to the Central Intelligence Agency’s classified review of its own efforts to arm insurgencies across the globe in its 67-year history. As RT previously reported, the CIA conducted the effectiveness analyses while the Obama administration contemplated arming rebels fighting against President Bashar Assad’s forces in Syria."
C00a8c,09/10/2016,conspiracy,"Many of you are probably aware of the ever increasing tensions between nations around the World, events are escalating very rapidly and many are suggesting we are on the brink of World War III. So are these predictions purely fear-mongering to draw in the public, or are we currently living on the brink of all-out World War ?

Luke Rudkowski from WeAreChange.org published a video talking about the imminent World War we are potentially facing:

Tensions between Russia and the US

President Joe Biden has publically threatened the Kremlin with Cyber attacks, Russia has retaliated and said such threats are ‘unprecedented’ , the Daily Mail reports:

As tensions continue to escalate between the U.S. and Russia, the Kremlin has called Vice President Joe Biden’s threat to ‘send a message’ through America’s own cyber strike ‘unprecedented’.

Russia said it would protect itself from a potentially unpredictable attack from the U.S., the New York Post reported.

‘The threats directed against Moscow and our state’s leadership are unprecedented because they are voiced at the level of the US vice president.

Russian state TV host Dmitry Kiselyov made a very dramatic warning of possible Nuclear War:

Critics call him the “Kremlin’s chief propagandist”. And like many other top Russian officials, he is on the Western sanctions blacklist.

But the warning he delivered to Washington in last night’s edition of his show News of the Week was, even for him, particularly dramatic. “Impudent behaviour” towards Russia may have “nuclear” consequences, he said.

“A Russian takes a long time to harness a horse, but then rides fast,” said the news anchor, quoting a famous Russian saying.

Kiselyov said that in recent days there had been a “radical change’ in the US-Russian relationship.

Moscow was taking action, he said, because of “the loud talk in Washington of a ‘Plan B’ for Syria. Everyone understands what this plan means: direct military force in Syria against President Assad’s forces and the Russian military”. [BBC News]

In the last few weeks, the tensions between Russia and the US have rapidly escalated, today we see yet another threat from the US to Russia.

Washington has threatened to impose “costs” on Russia outside the UN, over the Syrian conflict. It may mark the starkest warning so far from the U.S., which has been ramping up anti-Russian rhetoric in recent weeks, moving from criticism to direct threats. However just a month ago, U.S.-Russia talks on the Syrian peace process seemed warm and friendly.

Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) grilled Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and General Joseph Dunford on US military strategy in Syria. It is clear from this discussion that the objective of the US is primarily to remove Assad from power in Syria, with the destruction of ISIS/ISIL rarely mentioned.

General Joseph Dunford also states he has no doubt in his mind that the attack on a foreign aid convey was done so by Russian aircraft, yet within the same breath states he doesn’t have the facts, and that it was either the Russians or the regime. So clearly Dunford must have doubts in his mind about Russia’s part in the attack.

“I don’t have the facts,” Dunford said, when asked about the convoy attack by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut). “It was either the Russians or the regime,” he added.

“There is no doubt in my mind that the Russians are responsible,” whether directly or because they backed the government in Damascus, Dunford said, describing the attack as “an unacceptable atrocity.”

A suggestion that creating a ‘No-fly Zone‘ in Syria was also made by Hillary Clinton, here is what Dunford said about this when asked by Senator Wicker:

“What about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped? What do you think of that option?” asked Wicker.

“Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia. That is a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I’m not going to make,” said the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff suggesting the policy was too hawkish even for military leaders.

However, Russia has taken the initiative and placed themselves in a position to control Syrian Airspace already, WND reports:

Russia has beaten the United States to a key strategy in Syria with its new ability to create a no-fly zone, delivered by a new S-300 surface-to-air missile system, according to military analysts.

Word of the development comes in a report from Reuters, which cited its own analysis of “publicly available tracking data.”

That shows that Russia has been building up forces in Syria since last month when a ceasefire plan collapsed.

Among the benefits of the “increased manpower” likely are specialists to run the S-300 system, which will grant the country better “ability to control air space in Syrian where Moscow’s forces support the government of President Bashar al-Assad, and could be aimed at deterring tougher U.S. action.”

“The S-300 basically gives Russia the ability to declare a no-fly zone over Syria,” Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told Reuters.

Over 40 million people have taken part in an unprecedented civil defence exercise which has been running from October 4th until today the 7th October.

Russian ministers have also announced that they have built underground nuclear bunkers capable of holding 12 million people.

“The main goal of the drill is to practice organization of management during civil defense events and emergency and fire management, to check preparedness of management bodies and forces of civil defense on all levels to respond to natural and man-made disasters and to take civil defense measures,” according to the the Ministry of the Russian Federation for Civil Defence, Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters.

Russia and China build on an alliance

We saw the beginning of this back in July when China announced they will begin military drills in the south China sea with Russia:

The Chinese defense ministry announced Thursday that in September it will hold “routine” military drills with Russia in the South China Sea.

Historically in pre-War era times, a state of civil unrest is present in societies. If we take a look at the current state of the US and Europe right now Civil unrest would be an understatement in describing the current condition of society.

However this civil unrest has not arisen naturally, it has been manufactured by creating multiple problems. With the ultimate goal of dividing people, turning the people in society against each other. A prime example of this is the ‘Immigration crisis’ which we have seen unfolding in Europe. Millions of people are flooding into Europe from the Middle East, many of which have been displaced by War and destruction in their own countries. The West have been major players in the crisis, by arming both sides of multiple conflicts throughout the middle east for over a decade now they have destroyed entire Countries.

On one hand, there are people who will welcome any immigrant into their lands, without question or thought ; then there are those that would like nothing more than to close the borders and remove any immigrant that has already made it to their lands. This crisis is responsible for a new uprising of neo-nazi groups within Europe, self-perpetuating hate groups that due to brainwashing and often the lack of education spread hatred and promote violence against anyone who doesn’t look like a caucasian-European:

However, those that are the polar opposite of these neo-nazi groups can be just as dangerous in society, allowing anybody and everybody to pass through into Europe in the numbers which we are seeing is something that is undoubtedly going to lead to a clash in cultural behaviour. It is not racist or prejudiced to acknowledge that large numbers of people from cultural backgrounds which are very different from those in the lands to which they are migrating to will have some very dangerous results.

People on either side of this argument are fighting among themselves, the Liberal Political Left are protesting on the streets and suggesting we should all take immigrants into our homes, which in a World which is Black and White would be a great idea – but although a number of the people flooding into Europe are genuine victims of War requiring refuge, there are a large proportion of which are opportunist young males. If all this was a naturally occurring crisis, generated by a naturally occurring War, which was started because of naturally occurring terrorists then this whole situation would be far easier to deal with. However, this is simply not the case.

Terrorist groups such as Al-qaeda and now the more prominent Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL/IS) are a creation of the West, armed and funded by the US and its allies. These terror groups are used to disrupt regimes within the Country they reside, once the conflict is out of control the US and their allies begin military intervention and destroy the Country. This has happened in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and is happening now in Syria.

David Icke explains this very well in his latest videocast:

‘The policy of maintaining control over one’s subordinates or opponents by encouraging dissent between them, thereby preventing them from uniting in opposition.’

The most effective way to break any society down and rule them completely is by dividing them. Whether it be wealth, political viewpoint, moral standing, gender, race, religion, they all form huge divides in our society and are being pushed by the state-funded media. When a nation has been broken down into multiple groups all with conflicting interests it is far easier for a Government to carry out actions which would be otherwise opposed, such as generating the requirements for a World War.

This clip from the 1947 film ‘Don’t Be A Sucker’ makes a very good point, a point which is just as applicable today as it was before World War II:

George Carlin also puts the point out brilliantly that in the end, we are all very similar in this following clip:

Who benefits in times of War ?

War is nothing more than a battle over Earths land and it’s resources, as the majority of the Worlds population slip into greater poverty and deprivation a very small number of people acquire further wealth and power. The obvious beneficiaries of any war are the weapons manufacturers, who see production rates increase astronomically as they supply both sides of a War.

‘The business of war is profitable. In 2011, the 100 largest contractors sold $410 billion in arms and military services. Just 10 of those companies sold over $208 billion. Based on a list of the top 100 arms-producing and military services companies in 2011 compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 companies with the most military sales worldwide.’ [source]

Another major profiteer from War has always been historically the infamous Rockefeller family. During World War II Rockefellers Standard Oil company were supply both Nazi Germany and the United States with Oil.

The alliance of Standard Oil with the Nazis wasn’t well regarded by the USgovernment, above all after the entered into the war after Pearl Harbour, on December 7 th, 1941. Officials remembered an old law, “Trading with the Enemy“, and opened a formal investigation against Standard Oil.

In March 1942, the Pentagon begged President Roosevelt to stop the investigation, to protect war production and oil supply. Roosevelt agreed. The Company paid a fine of 5000 dollars and promised to stop fuel supply for the enemies.

Standard Oil tried to supply Nazi Germany via neutral countries. Standard Oil of New Jersey sent a young lawyer from their legal department to Venezuela, full of petroleum. And in 1940, Socony-Vacuum sent William Mosetti to Argentina. The country was friendly to the Axis but entered only in March 45 into the war against Germany. [source]

The Rockefeller family are still to this day very active in profiteering from the suffering of others and are big players in Social engineering.

Social Engineering has been used throughout history to control the opinions and therefore the actions of the victim population. The process occurs from birth through to death and is prominent in every aspect of our lives, from education through to media.

A very good example which shows you just how desperate the human race is to conform and be part of the majority is this following clip:

This desperate willingness to conform is what allows such easy control of a population. Not surprisingly the biggest players in Social Engineering are the Rockefeller family, behind every major new development and social change over the last century a trace can be linked back to them.

The family holds no secrets to their part in manipulating World events and social constructs, taken from ‘David Rockefeller’s Memoirs’:

“For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure–one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.

Social Engineering is probably the most effective method the Elite have had to keep and build the power structure they have over the majority, it has been responsible for most major conflicts we have seen in our human society over the last few Centuries.

The World we are living in with all its conflict, pain and suffering are no accident, they are by design. The continual war we have seen in the Middle-east over the last few decades is all part of a pre-determined plan. In an interview with Amy Goodwin from Democracy Now, General Wesley Clarke describes a conversation he had at the Pentagon:

So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan.

I said, “Are we still going to war with Iraq?” And he said, “Oh, it’s worse than that.” He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, “I just got this down from upstairs” — meaning the Secretary of Defense’s office — “today.”

And he said, “This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.”

I said, “Is it classified?” He said, “Yes, sir.”

I said, “Well, don’t show it to me.”

And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, “You remember that?”

He said, “Sir, I didn’t show you that memo! I didn’t show it to you!”

If we do see a third World War unfold it will be by choice, it will be no accident. If World War III suits their agenda, which we believe it will, then World War III will happen. The only way to prevent the designs of this small Elite group of individuals occurring is through non-compliance. But as you’ve seen in the earlier clips, non-compliance is a trait humans often lack, partly through social engineering carried out by this very same group, but also as with most mammals we are naturally inclined to follow the herd, the majority.

There are many more aspects to look at which all point towards an imminent World War, we have only just scraped the surface.

It’s important to not feel helpless and that nothing you can do will change what is to come, this is exactly how we have been engineered to think. We are after all the many, and they are the few. It’s important to follow the propaganda that our mainstream media is pumping out and condemn it for what it is. Talk to your work colleagues, your friends, your family about the lies and deceptions being fabricated. Use social media to share material which gets people thinking, we need people in the millions to be questioning everything they read and hear."
C061b3,01/01/2019,conspiracy,"Black seed oil (Nigella sativa) is bursting with health benefits, so much so that not even the medical industry can deny its health benefits. With over 600 peer-reviewed studies, this is something everybody should have in their cupboard!

From Wikipedia here is a quick description of the plant:

Nigella sativa (black-caraway, also known as nigella or kalonji), often called black cumin, is an annual flowering plant in the family Ranunculaceae, native to south and southwest Asia.

Nigella sativa grows to 20–30 cm (7.9–11.8 in) tall, with finely divided, linear (but not thread-like) leaves. The flowers are delicate, and usually colored pale blue and white, with five to ten petals.

The black caraway fruit is a large and inflated capsule composed of three to seven united follicles, each containing numerous seeds which are used as spice, sometimes as a replacement for black cumin (Bunium bulbocastanum).

The best article we could find on this amazing plant was from Dr. Axe, he clearly states the seven major health benefits that Black seed oil has to offer. Below we have taken the highlights of his article, for the full article goto his website here at draxe.com:

Quite possibly, the most promising research has been done connecting Nigella sativa to multi-drug resistant bacteria. This is a real big deal because these so-called “superbugs” are becoming a significant public health risk. According to the National Institute of Health: (2)
• Strains of bacteria and viruses that are antimicrobial-resistant are becoming virtually impossible to treat; including HIV, staphylococcal, tuberculosis, influenza, gonorrhea, candida, and malaria.
• Between 5 – 10% of all hospital patients develop an infection from superbugs.
• More than 90,000 of these patients die every year, up from 13,300 patient deaths in 1992.
• People infected with superbugs typically have longer hospital stays, require more complicated treatment and don’t recover as well.

A study conducted by Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College researchers set out to determine just how potent black seed oil against some of these superbugs and pared it against several antibiotics such as Amoxicillin, Gatifloxacin and Tetracycline. According to the study,

“Out of 144 strains tested, most of which were resistant to a number of antibiotics, 97 were inhibited by the oil of black cumin!”

The article goes on to list the seven major health benefits of the plant:

Croatian scientists evaluated the antitumor activity of thymoquinone and thymohydroquinone in mice and discovered that the two phytochemicals in black seed oil can resulted in 52% decrease in tumor cells! (10)

The liver is one of the most important organs in the body. Nearly every toxin gets processed through the liver, and the bile from the liver is the key to digesting fats and keeping your mind and body happy and healthy. For those that have struggled with poor liver function due to medication side effects, alcohol consumption, or disease, black seed oil could greatly speed the healing process. In a recent study scientists discovered that black seed oil benefits the function of the liver and helps prevent both damage and disease.

Explained in a recent article published by the Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism, researchers from the Indian Council of Medical Research highlight that black seed oil “causes gradual partial regeneration of pancreatic beta-cells, increases the lowered serum insulin concentrations and decreases the elevated serum glucose.” (13) This is actually quite profound because Nigella sativa is one of the few substances on the planet that is suggested to help prevent both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

The Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders published a study last June systemically reviewing the literature for plants that have anti-obesity properties and discovered that black seed oil was amongst the most effective natural remedies on the planet.

Probably one of the most unique black seed oil benefits is its uncanny ability to help restore hair loss. No one quite understands why it happens, but it’s not too hard to guess that it has something to do with its powerful antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. By strengthening hair follicles, there is very good reason to see how black seed oil can help promote strengthened hair roots.

Produced in the retina, choroid and epidermis, melanin are pigments that protect the skin from damage. You probably are most family with it being the main chemical responsible for giving our eyes and skin their individual color. Known to promote and inhibit melanogenesis (melanin production), black seed oil benefits on the skin and other cells are profoundly healing.

Of all the superbugs that black seed oil can kill, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most important. MRSA is plaguing hospitals and nursing homes across the globe because ordinary staph infections are becoming resistant to generic antibiotics. The elderly population is especially at risk because it is generally associated with invasive procedures such as surgeries, intravenous tubing, and artificial joints. (20) Primarily due to weakened immunity, the growing population of senior citizens has made MRSA a global public health risk.

Thankfully, one of the strongest black seed oil benefits comes to the rescue. Pakistan scientists took several strains of MRSA and discovered that each one was sensitive to N. Sativa, proving that black seed oil can help slow down or stop MRSA from spreading out of control. (21)

One of the most recognised health benefits though strangely has not been mentioned by Dr. Axe in his article, and that is its bronchial benefits, particularly Asthma. Even the defender and protector of state medicine, Wikipedia recognise this:

The most trials, and those of the best quality to date, provide preliminary support for its use in asthma (for both prevention and treatment of acute attacks)

C02177,04/05/2020,conspiracy,"So the existence and possibility of these psychosomatic events on a grand scale is clearly very real and a serious concern for Governments. So is it entirely out of the question that the current situation we find ourselves in regards to the Covid19 pandemic could be partially if not full attributed to a psychosomatic group event?

Lets consider what is required for a such a phenomenon to occur. Firstly, you would need large numbers of people to all follow and entrust the same information stream, in this case this would be Government, Health Authorities and Mainstream media. We certainly can all agree that this requirement has been met. Secondly, we need this trusted information stream to induce fear and panic into this large group of people, ensuring a perceived threat.

It’s fair to say that there has never been a time in recent history where so many people have all shared the same belief of threat from a common enemy, the virus.

Just think about it, over 50% of the World’s people are being told they must not leave their houses, they must not come into contact with other people, not even family that live beyond their own accommodation. The media has been pumping out a continual stream of fear inducing stories of death and suffering from around the World.

Think back to how this began, in Wuhan, China where we saw a continual stream of frightening footage, people collapsing on the street, entire populations being placed into quarantine because of this unknown invisible enemy. The rest of the World looked on in horror and disbelief, priming their minds for what potentially was heading their way.

So, i’ll put this to you – could what we are currently living through be largely attributed to a Psychosomatic event on a global scale. With the media and governments having the ability to feed the minds of the masses with the same fear inducing information, whether by deceptive intention or not, much of the excess mortality we are seeing ‘could’ be coming from a viral fear, rather than a novel coronavirus.

If this theory has any element of reality to it, the vaccine for COVID19 will be effective regardless, it will provide relief from the fear – basically a placebo. The vaccine has been placed by the media and establishment as the one thing that can save us all.

Now, this theory is more than just plausible, it’s certainly on some scale happening, the big question is just how much of what we are seeing is psychosomatic and the even bigger question is, whether it is by malicious intention. This, we will leave you to speculate on.

What would be interesting to know is the fear index of various nations throughout this pandemic and how this correlates to the mortality rates.

Please let us know what you think about this in the comments below."
C03561,15/03/2019,conspiracy,"Hardeman, 70, sprayed more than 6,000 gallons of Roundup in his lifetime, according to his lawyer, he used the toxic formula on his large plot of land in Sonoma County, California, about 60 miles north of San Francisco.

This isn’t the first lawsuit against Bayer, over 11200 US plaintiffs have sued the company in state or federal courts on claims that Roundup Weed Killer had caused their Cancer. This is the second suite against the chemical giant to go to trial and the first to end up in a federal court.

Bayer argue that Hardeman’s Cancer was caused by hepatitis C which the plaintiff has been suffering with for decades. However, the case for Roundup being the cause is also a strong one.

A study which came out just last month concludes that exposure to Glyphosate-based herbicides such as roundup could increase the risk of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma by up to 41%.

The Authors of the study concluded that:

‘All of the meta-analyses conducted to date, including our own, consistently report the same key finding: exposure to (glyphosate-based herbicides) are associated with an increased risk of NHL,’ [Source]

If the verdict goes in favour of the claims this could set the ball rolling for an estimated $5 billion in lawsuits being awarded to those damaged by the lethal herbicide."
C07208,10/02/2016,conspiracy,"​The US Supreme Court upheld biotech giant Monsanto’s claims on genetically-engineered seed patents and the company’s ability to sue farmers whose fields are inadvertently contaminated with Monsanto materials.

The high court left intact Monday a federal appeals court decision that threw out a 2011 lawsuit from the Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association and over 80 other plaintiffs against Monsanto that sought to challenge the agrochemical company’s aggressive claims on patents of genetically-modified seeds. The suit also aimed to curb Monsanto from suing anyone whose field is contaminated by such seeds.

The group of plaintiffs, which included many individual American and Canadian family farmers, independent seed companies and agricultural organizations, were seeking preemptive protections against Monsanto’s patents. The biotech leviathan has filed over 140 lawsuits against farmers for planting the company’s genetically-engineered seeds without permission, while settling around 700 other cases without suing.

None of the plaintiffs are customers of Monsanto and none have licensing agreements with the company. The group argued that they do not want Monsanto’s genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) and want legal protection in case of inadvertent contact with the company’s products.

The appeals court decision was based on Monsanto’s supposed promise not to sue farmers whose crops – including corn, soybeans, cotton, canola and others – contained traces of the company’s biotechnology products.

In a June 2013 ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC said it was inevitable, as the farmers’ argued, that contamination from Monsanto’s products would occur. Yet the appeals panel also said the plaintiffs do not have standing to prohibit Monsanto from suing them should the company’s genetic traits end up on their holdings “because Monsanto has made binding assurances that it will not ‘take legal action against growers whose crops might inadvertently contain traces of Monsanto biotech genes (because, for example, some transgenic seed or pollen blew onto the grower’s land).'”

The panel’s reference to “traces” of Monsanto’s patented genes means farms that are affected by less than 1 percent.

The plaintiffs asked Monsanto to pledge not to sue, but the company rebuffed the request, saying, “A blanket covenant not to sue any present or future member of petitioners’ organizations would enable virtually anyone to commit intentional infringement.”

Monsanto’s GMO seeds are designed to withstand the company’s own ubiquitous herbicide, Roundup. Recently, questions have begun to arise from the bioengineered seed’s resistance to pestilence, which has caused some farmers to increase their use of traditional pesticides.

“Monsanto never has and has committed it never will sue if our patented seed or traits are found in a farmer’s field as a result of inadvertent means,” said Kyle McClain, the Monsanto’s chief litigation counsel, according to Reuters.

“The lower courts agreed there was no controversy between the parties,” McClain added, “and the Supreme Court’s decision not to review the case brings closure on this matter.”

Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association President Jim Gerritsen expressed disappointment that the Supreme Court reaffirmed the previous ruling, refusing to hear the case.

“The Supreme Court failed to grasp the extreme predicament family farmers find themselves in,” said Gerritsen, an organic seed farmer in Maine. “The Court of Appeals agreed our case had merit. However … safeguards they ordered are insufficient to protect our farms and our families.”

‘Using rats in experiments carefully designed to mimic the second-hand smoke exposures that humans encounter, the researchers found that the chemical components of tobacco smoke affect fetal brain development throughout pregnancy.'[source]

The second-hand smoke exposure damages the regions of the brain involved in learning, memory and emotional responses. The impact was greatest at late gestation, however, adverse effects were still apparent in the neurodevelopment of the fetus even prior to conception.

“This finding has important implications for public health, because it reinforces the need to avoid secondhand smoke exposure not only during pregnancy, but also in the period prior to conception, or generally for women of childbearing age,”[source]

Though the effects of smoking are now common knowledge to the majority of the Worlds population and even the effects of second-hand smoke are now well known, however only now do we have evidence which shows the damaging of second-hand smoke on unborn babies, Slotkin concluded his interview with the following statement:

“Our study clearly shows there is no stage in which tobacco smoke is innocuous to the developing fetus,” Slotkin said. “We warn women about smoking during pregnancy, and most people are aware that secondhand smoke exposure is also harmful to the fetus, but our study is the first to show that exposure prior to conception is potentially damaging, as well. The public health implications should be obvious.” [source]"

Johnson & Johnson have recalled batch number 22318RB which included the powder containing the small amounts of asbestos and will do further tests to try and establish how the powder became contaminated with the highly toxic substance.

An FDA spokeswoman, Gloria Sanchez-Contreras, said that the contaminated bottle contained chrysotile fibers, a type of asbestos. The FDA recommended that people stop using that lot immediately and contact J&J for a refund.

This isn’t the first time J&J’s talc products have been in the spotlight, just last year 22 women, 6 of which died, received a total of $4.7 Billion in damages for their ovarian cancer which was believed to be caused by the companies talc products.

Their lawyers alleged the company knew its talc was contaminated with asbestos since the 1970s but failed to warn consumers about the risks.

There are still 15,500 lawsuits remaining regarding these products which have yet to be settled.

Then there is the companies recent criticism in the opoid academic that has swept the US. Johnson & Johnson were ordered to pay $572m for their part in fuelling Oklahoma’s opioid addiction crisis, a judge in the US state ruled.

Johnson & Johnson have continued to deny any wrong doing and so far have failed to accept any responsibility in their part of any of the above lawsuits. In regards to the above case regarding the 22 women with ovarian cancer they stated:

“We sympathize with anyone suffering from cancer, and we understand patients and their families are seeking answers. The facts are clear — Johnson’s Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos nor does it cause cancer, as reflected in more than 40 years of scientific evidence,”

However, it would seem now their Baby Powder products do, or at least in this particular batch contain asbestos.

C01754,25/01/2020,conspiracy,"This is a 2015 documentary produced in Denmark, which centres around three girls who received the Gardasil vaccine against HPV and are now facing serious illness. As you will well know if you’ve been following our page, the HPV Vaccine, Gardasil, has time and time again been accused of causing horrendous injuries all over the World.

Thursday, March 26, 2015, TV2 one of Denmark’s national television stations aired a Danish documentary on HPV vaccines entitled, The Vaccinated Girls – Sick and Betrayed. It focused on the condition of 3 girls suffering from serious new medical conditions after being vaccinated against HPV with Gardasil. The one thing they have in common with thousands of other girls around the world is they were healthy before they got the vaccine – now, they are seriously ill.

All three girls have been examined from head to toe with no conclusive diagnosis and no help with their symptoms, much like the girls in other countries where HPV vaccines are being used.

During the documentary, two Danish doctors from Frederiksberg Hospital said they have never seen anything similar to this during their entire careers. Both doctors said they had sent correspondence to the Danish Health and Medicines Authority a total of four times during the last year to warn them of possible adverse events after HPV injections.

Dr. Louise Brinth of Frederiksberg Hospital has personally examined around 80 girls whom she suspects may be suffering adverse effects of HPV vaccinations. She states:

They are all dizzy, they pass out, and so the vast majority of them severe headache – often chronic headaches. They have abdominal pain and nausea. They have weird muscle movements, they cannot control. And they’re very tired….

We see a pattern that screams to heaven, and that should be examined by some solid research.

Yes, there is a pattern, but it is not the same as saying that there is a connection. When we see a pattern in how some reports, there is a basis for making some more explanations, and delve into this stuff. Now, the fact that the vaccine is approved by the European Medicines Agency EMA, and that is, they are the ones who make the safety assessment.

While conducting research prior to the production of this documentary, TV2 requested the Danish Health and Medicines Authority to provide full disclosure of all documents pertinent to the HPV vaccination program in Denmark. Unfortunately, Director Henrik G. Jenson and his staff ’forgot’ to supply the news team with any information regarding the four warnings the Danish Health and Medicines Authority had received from medical professionals in their country.

If you haven’t watched it already we highly recommend the following two documentaries:

While the mainstream science community and vaccine advocates continue to deny any of the claims being made by these thousands of teenage girls, a new bombshell study has just been published which raises serious concerns over the methodology used in the Gardasil HPV Trials."
C0168f,15/01/2019,conspiracy,"The idea that another planet exists within our solar system has been circulating for centuries, Planet X as it was called prior to the downgrading of Pluto which brought the total number of known existing planets down to eight.

Planet X often gets referred to as Nibiru as well, this name is derived from the ancient writings of the Sumerians which according to Zakariah Sitchen talked of the Annunaki, an alien race who came from a planet called Nibiru.

This alien race according to Sitchen genetically engineered Humans mixing their own DNA with existing lifeforms on earth.

A little far fetched it maybe, but fascinating nevertheless. Regardless though scriptures and tablets have throughout history, all over the World referenced an additional planet within out solar system.

Nibiru translated from Sumerian is literally 12th Planet. The reason for 12th rather than 10th was because they included both the sun and the moon as planets, or so historians believe.

A new discovery has been made which researchers hope could help them in the hunt for Nibiru. Another planetary object has been discovered by the team, it’s a dwarf planet and is about 120 Astronomical Units (AU) from the sun. They have nicknamed the discovery ‘Farout’

The team is hoping they will be able to use distant planets such as this one to help them discover the existence of Nibiru. Because Nibiru is said to be so vast in size it’s gravitational pull on smaller planetary objects is thought to be extremely far-reaching.

This gravitational pull on smaller planets will simply put, distort the trajectory of its orbit, which can then be monitored and from this data, the location of a ninth planet can hopefully be determined.

The team also found another planet nicknamed ‘The Goblin’ back in October of 2018.

C04b49,01/10/2016,conspiracy,"Muammar Gaddafi, Libya’s leader for over four decades was murdered on 20th October 2011 during the Battle of Sirte at the age of 69.

The US, UK and their allies labelled Gaddafi as a tyrant, a tyrant that needed to be removed.

The Obama administration, NATO and the UK Government and all the usual suspects were making some ridiculous claims, none of which had any supportive evidence.

Muammar Gaddafi was bombing his own people

This is a total fabrication, supported by no evidence. The BBC on the 21st February 2011 reported that “Witnesses say warplanes have fired on protesters in the city ”

However U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, when asked if there was any evidence of these alleged bombings responded, “We’ve seen the press reports, but we have no confirmation of that”.

Admiral Mullen echoed Gates’s response with, “That’s correct. We’ve seen no confirmation whatsoever”.

Gaddafi used Rape as a weapon of War

Back in June 2011, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton she was “deeply concerned” that Gaddafi’s troops were participating in widespread rape in Libya. “Rape, physical intimidation, sexual harassment, and even so-called ‘virginity tests’ have taken place in countries throughout the region,” she said.

Yet no evidence was ever found to support these claims, Amnesty International investigated these claims but turned up nothing to support such claims.

An investigation by Amnesty International has failed to find evidence for these human rights violations and in many cases has discredited or cast doubt on them. It also found indications that on several occasions the rebels in Benghazi appeared to have knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence. The findings by the investigators appear to be at odds with the views of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, who two weeks ago told a press conference that “we have information that there was a policy to rape in Libya those who were against the government. Apparently, he [Colonel Gaddafi] used it to punish people.”

These accusations are just more lies and propaganda entirely fabricated by the West. Any claims made by Libyan rebels at the time were inconsistent and blatant lies:

In one instance two captured pro-Gaddafi soldiers presented to the international media by the rebels claimed their officers, and later themselves, had raped a family with four daughters. Ms Rovera says that when she and a colleague, both fluent in Arabic, interviewed the two detainees, one 17 years old and one 21, alone and in separate rooms, they changed their stories and gave differing accounts of what had happened. “They both said they had not participated in the rape and just heard about it,” she said. “They told different stories about whether or not the girls’ hands were tied, whether their parents were present and about how they were dressed.” [source]

Just to make these claims even darker and twisted they added an additional claim on the back of the ‘Rape as a Weapon’ narrative. Soldiers were allegedly powering these rapes with Viagra.

This Viagra story was first published by Al Jazeera, in collaboration with its rebel partners, favoured by the Qatari regime that funds Al Jazeera.

In a startling declaration to the UN Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice also asserted that Gaddafi was supplying his troops with Viagra to encourage mass rape. She offered no evidence whatsoever to back up her claim. Indeed, U.S. military and intelligence sources flatly contradicted Rice, telling NBC News that “there is no evidence that Libyan military forces are being given Viagra and engaging in systematic rape against women in rebel areas”. Rice is a liberal interventionist who was one of those to persuade Obama to intervene in Libya. She utilised this myth because it helped her make the case at the UN that there was no “moral equivalence” between Gaddafi’s human rights abuses and those of the insurgents. [source]

Although these were merely rumours, they were soon passed to the Western press as facts and all the major media outlets ran the story.

Gaddafi provided equal rights for Women, free education for all, free healthcare, free housing for all and a revolutionary man-made river, providing fresh water throughout the desert land that is Libya. These societal implementations seem like polar opposites to acts of tyranny.

Even the BBC recognised these achievements:

Colonel Gaddafi dreamed of seeing an abundance of fresh water in Libya, and wanted to make his home country stand as a proud and free nation.

Unfortunately, NATO put a quick end to Gaddafi’s ‘Great Man-Made River’ before all five stages were complete. Much of the pipe work was destroyed by bombing.

The Threat of Libya’s Oil and Gold to French Interests

The following excerpt has been taken from The Foreign Policy Journal :

Though the French-proposed U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 claimed the no-fly zone implemented over Libya was to protect civilians, an April 2011 email [archived here] sent to Hillary with the subject line “France’s client and Qaddafi’s gold” tells of less noble ambitions.

The email identifies French President Nicholas Sarkozy as leading the attack on Libya with five specific purposes in mind: to obtain Libyan oil, ensure French influence in the region, increase Sarkozy’s reputation domestically, assert French military power, and to prevent Gaddafi’s influence in what is considered “Francophone Africa.”

Most astounding is the lengthy section delineating the huge threat that Gaddafi’s gold and silver reserves, estimated at “143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver,” posed to the French franc (CFA) circulating as a prime African currency. In place of the noble sounding “Responsibility to Protect” (R2P) doctrine fed to the public, there is this “confidential” explanation of what was really driving the war [emphasis mine]:

Though this internal email aims to summarize the motivating factors driving France’s (and by implication NATO’s) intervention in Libya, it is interesting to note that saving civilian lives is conspicuously absent from the briefing.

Instead, the great fear reported is that Libya might lead North Africa into a high degree of economic independence with a new pan-African currency.

French intelligence “discovered” a Libyan initiative to freely compete with European currency through a local alternative, and this had to be subverted through military aggression.

The above mentioned are just a fraction of the lies and deception surrounding Gaddafi and Libya, but its clear that what we in the West have been told, what is now being scribed in the History Books of new Western Academia is fabricated, it is nothing more than a Western Narrative which was designed to allow Western power to destroy Libya and Gaddafi with as little public resistance as possible.

Another Country torn to pieces, it’s children placed into a permanent nightmare by the hands of Western power. Unforgivable."
C02f8d,06/06/2019,conspiracy,"The official trailer for the latest Call of Duty was released a few days ago, and it features the Syria narrative management operation known as the White Helmets depicted in heroic roles. Characters wearing the organization’s signature headgear are seen clearing rubble in part of the trailer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

To give you an idea how popular the CoD franchise is, as of this writing the official Youtube version of the trailer has 27 million views.

To be clear, the characters in the game are most certainly intended to resemble the White Helmets of Syria, and their presence there is most certainly intended to increase support for and interest in that group. How do I know? Its game writer has explicitly said so.

“Kurosaki says he wants ‘Call of Duty’ to be spoken of as on par with the best war films, and he hopes ‘Modern Warfare’ will inspire fans to check out the harrowing and eye-opening documentaries ‘The White Helmets’ or ‘Last Man in Aleppo,” the LA Times reports.

The White Helmets are what legendary journalist John Pilger describes as “a complete propaganda construct“, an operation designed by former British army officer and private military contractor James Le Mesurier to manipulate the narrative about what’s going on in Syria. This excellent half-hour mini-documentary by James Corbett clearly outlines the way the operation is used to create footage implicating the Assad government in the slaughter of civilians via chemical weapons attacks and other camera-friendly war crimes, the mountain of evidence of their ties to literal terrorist organizations in Syria, and the western funding and media manipulations that have been pouring into elevating the outfit.

It’s a brilliant invention, really. Have a purportedly neutral group filming on the ground in “rebel”-held areas (where the White Helmets exclusively operate), and you can ensure an endless supply of footage which can be used to paint a longtime western target for regime change as a barbarian who needs to be ousted. And indeed, the extremist jihadist factions which overran Syria with the backingof the US and its allies nearly succeeded in toppling Assad prior to Russia’s intervention, and we may be certain that the agenda to control who rules over the geostrategically crucial region remains as intact as ever.

The pro-White Helmets propaganda is not Call of Duty‘s first foray into US military narrative management. As noted by journalist Max Blumenthal in April, an earlier CoD game depicted the assassination of the leader of Venezuela and, bizarrely, attacking Venezuela’s hydroelectric dam and energy grid with the goal of causing power outages like the ones the nation has been struggling with. Citing public information, Blumenthal documents how such games have been “developed with substantial input from America’s military intelligence apparatus”, as well as the CoD designer’s involvement with the Pentagon and the NATO narrative management firm the Atlantic Council.

People playing these games, mostly impressionable young men, are manipulated into desiring to accomplish the goals that are laid out for them in order to win, all of which involve killing and many of which happen to align with preexisting US military agendas. They are desensitized to mass military violence, trained to support and identify with US military campaigns, and taught that being a member of the military might just be a fun and noble way to spend one’s future.

Propaganda in video games doesn’t get the kind of pushback you see against propaganda in news media and movies, largely because the content in the games is generally only viewed individually by those who are engrossed in playing them. It’s this whole closed-off world that is manipulating minds with very little scrutiny compared to other forms of media, which is troubling, because the video game industry is so vast that for many years its earnings have eclipsed those of the movie and music industries combined.

This needs more attention. The sane, healthy response to learning that one’s government and its allies were arming and training terrorist groups in Syria would have been screaming, earth-shaking rage for months, accompanied by a demand for an unequivocal apology, immediate repair of all damage done, and war crimes tribunals for everyone who was involved. Instead, the news passed by with barely a whisper, and now when you see Syria mentioned it’s generally to condemn its president for fighting back against that unforgivably depraved act of regime change interventionism. This has been happening because people have been propagandized. Nothing will change until we find a way to help human minds unplug from the narrative control matrix and awaken to what’s really going on.

C056d3,30/06/2016,conspiracy,"Another teenage girl has been seriously disabled following her HPV Vaccination, another tragic story adding to a very long and repetitive list of teenage girls who’s lives will never be the same following their HPV Jab.

Chantele Nielsen, 13, was vaccinated against cervical cancer in April, soon after her mother claims she began fainting regularly to the extent now that she is bound to a wheelchair.

‘When it first happened she was unable to talk for 14 hours. She couldn’t remember what day it was or answer any simple maths questions.’ , Chantele’s mother said.

‘She once had an episode which left her completely paralysed in the bath when I left her for two minutes.’, for Leissa, Chantele’s mother it has been heartbreaking to watch her daughter go from a young, active happy girl to a frightened, incapacitated girl who at times doesn’t even recognise her own mother.

This is not an isolated incident in fact we are hearing of young girls affected by the Vaccine all the time. Even the Daily Mail recently published an article titled Tens of thousands of teenage girls believed to have fallen ill with debilitating illnesses after routine HPV cervical cancer jab. Meanwhile Gardasil the Vaccine Manufacturer claim the risks are extremely low for adverse reactions derived from the vaccine.

Only a few weeks ago we heard the story of Shazel Zaman, 13, who was suffering with a severe headache, vomiting and dizziness after having the HPV vaccine and her symptoms became so severe that her family took her to Fairfield Hospital in Bury. The doctor dismissed her claims that it maybe related to the HPV jab she’d had just prior to the sudden illness and sent her home citing she probably had a ‘mild’ stomach bug.

She was found collapsed and unconscious with no pulse an hour later at her home in Bury, and died in hospital four hours later.

According to the Daily Mail:

Her sister, Maham Hussain, 19, said: ‘She had the injection on the Wednesday. On Friday she was complaining of a sore arm – no swelling just redness.

‘On the Saturday she complained of a severe headache, and by the evening she was throwing up. Come Sunday she was very pale, and my aunt took her to Fairfield.

‘Whilst she was there she was in and out of consciousness. My aunt had to get a wheelchair for her.

‘She had a blood test, and her heart rate checked, and everything was said to be normal.

Just another Victim among thousands to an industry the refuses to accept any responsibility for the crimes they are now committing at an epidemic level.

“Not a Coincidence” is a campaign started by The Canary Party to address the medical community’s repeated excuse that the symptoms, too many experience, after vaccination are just coincidental. Seizures, fainting, rashes, allergies, GI dysfunction, loss of speech, etc, etc all labeled a coincidence. It’s time to end the excuses and start to listen to the injured and the parents of the injured.

They deserve a forum to be heard, they deserve a voice, respect, attention, hearings and answers. They need a medical discovery process that uses their symptoms and their progression of illness in the process of finding treatments. All injured are worthy of being treated individually instead of disregarding their many medical maladies because of a vaccination program that is not allowed to be questioned.

It’s time for the government, the medical community and the media to start taking into account the too many that are affected. Please take the time to hear from these beautiful, well-spoken girls and Moms tell their stories of injury after Gardasil."
C00bc9,26/01/2020,conspiracy,"As this deadly coronavirus continues to ramp up its spread across the World, we take a look at what we know, what we don’t know and everything in between.

What is the Coronavirus?

The following information has been pulled from the World Health Organisations website:

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.

Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.

Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

This particularly deadly strain of the Coronavirus has been named 2019-nCoV and was first discovered in mid-December of 2019.

Where Did The OutBreak Begin?

The outbreak of the new coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China.

Wuhan is the capital of Hubei province, People’s Republic of China. It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populated city in Central China, with a population of over 11 million.

The outbreak of 2019-nCoV was identified when an emerging cluster of people contracted pneumonia with no clear cause. A majority of the earliest cases were directly associated with stallholders who worked at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market which also sold live animals and game meat, though the exact origin of the virus has yet to be determined.

The virus was isolated by Chinese scientists on January 7th 2020 with genetic sequencing of the virus being made available to the WHO just a few days later on January 12th. The virus is 70% the same as the SARS virus. Whether it is as dangerous as the SARS virus however has yet to be determined.

How Contagious is the Virus?

Current estimations of the human-to-human transmission of the virus are between 2 and 4. It is still unknown if any animals are able to transmit the disease, though articles by Peking University, Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medical University, Ningbo University and Wuhan Biology Engineering College suggest that the most likely animals to also spread the disease are Bats and Snakes.

So far the number of cases being reported World Wide are growing by the minute, however, at the time of writing it is approximately 2000 confirmed cases, with the majority being in China.

China has reported 56 people to have died with 1,975 cases recorded.

Australia on Saturday confirmed its first case of the virus: a man who arrived in Melbourne from China a week ago.

France has reported three confirmed cases of the coronavirus in France, the first European country to be affected.

Japan’s health authorities confirmed a third case on Saturday. The country’s health ministry said a woman in her 30s who lives in Wuhan had contracted the virus.

Malaysia confirmed four cases on Saturday. All were Chinese nationals on holiday from Wuhan who arrived in the country from Singapore two days earlier.

Nepal has claimed a 32-year-old man arriving from Wuhan had the deadly disease.

Singapore has announced at least three cases – a 66-year-old man and his 37-year-old son, who arrived in Singapore on Monday from Wuhan, and a 52-year-old Wuhan woman, who arrived in the city-state on Tuesday.

South Korea confirmed its second case of the virus on Friday.

Taiwan has uncovered three cases so far. It has since advised against travel to Wuhan and Hubei province and on Friday said any arrivals from Wuhan would be rejected by immigration.

Thailand has detected five cases so far: four Chinese nationals from Wuhan and a 73-year-old Thai woman who came back from the Chinese city this month.

The USA announced a third confirmed case in Orange County, California. The patient is a traveller from Wuhan and was in good condition in isolation in a local hospital, the OC Health Agency said.

Vietnam on Thursday confirmed two cases of the virus: an infected man from Wuhan travelled to Ho Chi Minh City earlier this month and passed the virus on to his son.

How Deadly is the Virus?

Well, this information is still largely unknown, or at least not advertised by the press, however, based on current statistics of infections and deaths it works out at less than 3% – which when compared to something like Ebola which has been stated as having a 90% mortality rate it doesn’t seem quite the threat we are all being led to believe.

As with any major News event, there will always be conspiracy theories, and rightfully so, after all the Government and their media cohorts don’t have a great track record of honesty.

The first major social media remark to go viral was the patent for the Coronavirus that was filed in 2004 and granted in 2007 by the CDC and another that was filed by the Pirbright Institute in2015 and granted in 2018. However, this is simply standard procedure when scientists begin working on vaccines for a virus or simply want to understand the virus better.

While neither of these patents is evidence that the virus is man-made, it does not necessarily give us reason to dismiss the notion that this could indeed be a man-made variation of an existing virus.

Back in 2017, a controversial decision was made to lift a ban on creating deadly diseases, yes we kid you not.

Scientists could soon resume controversial experiments on germs with the potential to cause pandemics, as government officials have decided to finally lift an unusual three-year moratorium on federal funding for the work.

The research involves three viruses — influenza, SARS, and MERS — that could kill millions if they mutated in a way that let the germs spread quickly among people.

Biologists say they may need to alter these viruses in the lab to understand what genetic changes matter in starting pandemics, so they can understand the risks and get ready. But some of their past efforts to tinker with viruses have made other scientists uneasy.

Its also been reported by the Israeli press that the virus has been linked to a Chinese covert biological warfare laboratory:

The deadly animal virus epidemic spreading globally may have originated in a Wuhan laboratory linked to China’s covert biological weapons program, according to an Israeli biological warfare expert.

While there is no evidence yet to support these claims, it does raise the question on just how secure scientific research into viruses is. Alternatively, many people are speculating on whether this lethal virus was released intentionally to create panic and allow Governments to increase border controls and thus limit the movement of people on a worldwide scale.

Again, at this point it’s all theory and speculation – but whether or not this was a man-made disease or not it does show us just how powerful nature can be at taken us out quickly, should we really be trying to mutate these viruses intentionally in a laboratory for the sake of biological warfare or understanding how virus mutation works?

Wuhan has effectively been quarantined from the rest of the World, there is no public transport, no running fuel stations, no emergency numbers functioning. 11 million people have been isolated and many are still not fully aware of what exactly is going on.

Is sending an entire population into a panic, containing them, making them group together in their thousands to wait their turn to see a doctor really the best way to stem the spread of disease?

In the following video, a citizen of Wuhan talks about what he has seen and makes a plea for help:

We will keep this page updated with any new information as it comes in, but for now, don’t panic, but be sensible, stay healthy and question everything you read and hear, while this appears to be very real, its origins are certainly questionable and its lethality is still to be determined."

Then we have the racist side. Every racist in the country hijacked the Brexit moment to further their demonic aspirations. And it didn’t help that many Brexit politicians and parties used this to their gain. All jumping on the immigration bandwagon.

Lets look at the actual facts.

Everything that’s wrong with the world today is all linked to greed, big business and big government. The bankers bailout. The huge bonuses paid out from tax payers money. Large taxes forced upon those who also have to eat from food banks. Huge inequality, Mass immigration because big business and big government loved to bomb everyone else’s countries to steal their resource.

When government and business get too big, bad things always happen. When a world is run by a just a handful of privileged unelected elites, you know things are going to get bad. And this is what the tyrants want. They want total world control and they will do anything to get it. They will twist your mind with clever mind control techniques. They will get the whole world fighting. Then when no one is looking, they will step in and take total control.

The whole idea of the EU was to be a stepping stone to a NWO.

So for arguments sake. Lets just say we were better of financially in the EU.

Is that really a reason to sell yourself to a dictatorship of tyranny, and a collection of evil elites who wage illegal wars, rape children, murder innocent people, carry out hideous false flags killings and much more? Is it a reason to give up your freedom and sovereignty to unelected dictators?

No. This is not a good idea. The last person who wanted to have an integrated EU with unelected politicians as a stepping stone to a new world order, was none other than Hitler.

And this is what they still aim for. It might not be Hitler in the driving seat now, but the idea is the same. Total control and the enslavement of the people under a fascist state. Hitler was funded by the same people pushing for the EU today. The Rothschild’s, the Rockefeller, the Royal family, big government and big business. They are all related, literally.

Now how many of you are pro EU but anti TTIP, TPP and TISA?

TTIP, TPP and TISA are the building blocks to turn the EU and the rest of the world in to a one world system, a NWO. If you’re anti TTIP, TPP and TISA, then you can not be pro EU. It’s a total contradiction.

We as people don’t need government. Government is a mafia that dictates how you live for their own gain. The bigger the government the worse it becomes.

If you were voting to stay in EU because you believe you would make more money, then you are part of the problem. Greed does not trump freedom. When you have freedom, you don’t need money.

And lets not forget, no one voted to be part of a fascist state called the EU governed by unelected officials. People voted for the EC. Today, the EC doesn’t even exist. It was the Trojan horse to fool the people in to accepting what is now the EU and in the future will be the NWO.

So people. What do you want? Do you want to be government by fascist dictators and greedy bankers? Or do you want your freedom, sovereignty and to be safe, away from fascist tyrants trying to rule your life?

The EU, like the North Korea, is a totalitarian state?

We could write forever about how the EU is a failed state with many of it’s member itching to leave. Look how it turned out for Greece, Spain, Portugal, Cypress, Italy and Ireland. Countries destroyed under EU rule.

We could write about how under the EU we were not free to do life changing, ground braking trade deals with China, the worlds biggest economy. We could have spoken about how other countries, with the highest GDP’s and standards of living in the world, do just fine out side of Europe, such as Australia (Pro Brexit), Canada, Switzerland and Noway. Norway Tops Prosperity Ranking

But what will happen next? Despite all the facts, it’s going to be all about the infighting (by design). Where the whole country is divided based on which side of the propaganda you believed.

The bigoted parties such as Britain First and BNP will create an army of racists. The Tories will play the moral high ground, despite being responsible for the most extreme racism in the world with their genocide of brown people, bombing and killing people in foreign countries to steal land and resources.

In the short term, the economy will naturally go up and down. The government will use this as fear porn to introduce more austerity and take more of your freedoms.

New Islamic false flags will pop up with Brexit being blamed.

Then after everything is in dire-straights and falling apart (by design), a new referendum will be called and the tyrant will have the public backing they need to reenter their fascist state, the EU permanently. Just like they did in Ireland.

All you have to remember is this one important thing. FREEDOM. That’s what Brexit is all about.

Leave tyranny. Make yourself free. Don’t let the racist bigots, the tyrants, the fear mongers, the opportunists, tell you what to think, how to think and when to think.

Just remember, this is only about freedom. To live in a world free from the grasps of corporate and governmental corruption. To live without fear. To live without being dictated to. When you have that, you are the richest people in the world! That’s the real wealth of life.

Now the fight begins. The fight to keep your freedom, or should we say, what freedom you have left!

So What Do the Experts Say?

A short film setting out the democratic case for voting Leave in the forthcoming EU Referendum. The argument relies on a factual account of how the EU works, and an historical analysis of how much influence Britain has been able to wield within it, rather than scaremongering and conjecture.

David Icke may not be an expert ‘per se’, but he has certainly done a lot of research. I would say he probably knows more about the EU than the experts."

Though it is an ideal material for making airplanes, computers, and pens, the accumulation of aluminium in the body can have devastating consequences.

The Age of Aluminium profiles people whose health has been seriously impacted by unwitting exposure to aluminium, along with leading scientists as they explore the links between this known neurotoxin and a growing epidemic of chronic illnesses and disabilities.

In moving footage captured from Brazil to Hungary, the film traces the long-term impact of aluminium mining on the environment and those involved in its production. For those seeking answers to why breast cancer, dementia, autism, autoimmunity, allergies, and chronic fatigue are on the rise, The Age of Aluminum is a must-see film.

Aluminium, atomic number 13 in the Periodic Table of Elements, is a shiny silvery metal and the most abundant metal in the Earth’s crust. Aluminium’s chemical properties make it ideal for crafting into thousands of objects used on a daily basis. A highly reactive element that readily binds with many others to form useful products, aluminium also presents a danger to living creatures, as it has no role in living systems.

Until the process of smelting aluminium was discovered in the late 1800s (1889), little bioavailable aluminium entered living beings. Life on Earth evolved in the absence of bioavailable aluminium.

Aluminium has no biological function in any living organism and its bio-accumulation can result in dysfunction and toxicity. The lack of an evolutionary presence and role for aluminium in living systems has rendered all life defenceless to its mechanisms of toxicity. Aluminium is perceived by living things including humans as a foreign substance, or antigen, due to its lack of recognition in the biological environment, and as a toxin."
C00d32,23/09/2015,conspiracy,"Recently whilst at home we noticed that a Council Worker was parading around our neighbourhood spraying weeds. After watching him further he continued to spray along side the outside border of our front garden. Immediately we headed out the front door and approached the worker to inquire to exactly what he was spraying along our garden, our garden may I note which is full of Organic Vegetables and more often than not our young children. He informed us he was administering Monsanto’s Roundup. He knew nothing about the substance and could give us no personal knowledge to its potential dangers, as far as he was concerned it was perfectly safe to spray because the Council had not informed him of any restrictions of use, or potential dangers surrounding the substance. We asked him for the legally required datasheet on the product and about 10 minutes later he popped it through our door.

The datasheet from Monsanto as you can imagine is written by some kind of legal genius as every aspect of the information provided covers them from any potential issues that could arise from the substance.

Firstly as usual at the back of the leaflet the following statement is made:

Now that aside if you read through the leaflet they do state the following:

So apparently all is fine, People, Pets and wildlife need not be kept out of treated areas. But is it really fine , is there any reason to be worried about this product ? Well read on and decide for yourself

Although the UK classifies Glyphosate as Non-Hazardous many Countries have now banned the use of the substance due to health & environmental dangers incurred through its prolonged usage.
• France have now banned the sale of the product over the counter.
• Sri-Lanka have outright banned all Glyphosate products due to links to Kidney disease.
• Brazil are soon to ban the usage of Glyphosate
• Germany are heading towards a ban on Glyphosate
• and many more Countries have also banned or are planning to ban the substance.

So how is it here in the UK we are spraying it around Childrens play areas, outside people gardens, public pavements and walkways – with no warning signs to inform the public of the recent spraying of Glyphosate in the area?

Glyphosate has been linked to Cancer, Kidney Disease, DNA Damage and a whole host of other illnesses.

The UN agency based its decision on human, animal, and cell studies, says National Cancer Institute scientist emeritus, Aaron Blair who chaired the IARC review committee. The studies found glyphosate in farmworkers’ blood and urine, chromosomal damage in cells, increased risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in some people exposed, and tumor formation in some animal studies. [1]

Even the World Health Organisation (WHO) as corrupt as they are have had to admit “Roundup probably causes Cancer”:

Roundup, the world’s most widely used weedkiller, “probably” causes cancer, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) – WHO’s cancer agency – said that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide made by agriculture company Monsanto, was “classified as probably carcinogenic to humans”. [2]

Another study has found that Glyphosate causes ‘Chronic Kidney Failure’:

“The current study strongly favors the hypothesis that CKDu epidemic among farmers in dry zone of Sri Lanka is associated with, history of drinking water from a well that was abandoned. In addition, it is associated with spraying glyphosate and other pesticides in paddy fields.”

“Drinking well water and occupational exposure to Herbicides is associated with chronic kidney disease, in Padavi-Sripura, Sri Lanka.” [3]

Even the United States Environmental Agency states that Glyphosate is linked to Chronic Kidney Damage:

So it seems most Countries authorities have concerns to some degree with the product, yet here in the UK they are still freely spraying it around our children’s recreational areas, private property and Gardens with neither notice or consent.

This is not acceptable and we will be holding the Council accountable and also be demanding compensation for damaged crops. We would suggest anyone living in the UK who has seen Council workers spraying the local area and areas in close proximity to your garden to do the same thing.

We will post the Councils response to our complaint here as soon as we receive it. We will also be setting up a campaign to ban the use of Glyphosate products without consent of the local public in the coming months as well as a campaign to the UK Government for a total ban.

Please spread awareness about this and be careful where you let your Children play, you wouldn’t let your children play with the chemicals under your kitchen sink, or with your medicine cabinet so keep them away from all areas which may of been sprayed.

C0703f,11/06/2017,conspiracy,"It has emerged that the US-backed SDF have been using White Phosphorus on mass in a densely populated area of Raqqa, Syria. Video footage has gone viral of the this deadly weapons usage on social media:

Videos allegedly filmed in Raqqa and posted on social media showed highly incendiary munitions exploding over homes and buildings. International law permits the use of white phosphorus in order to cover troop movements, but the use of the munition in densely populated areas violates the requirement under international humanitarian law for all feasible precautions to be taken to avoid civilian injury and loss of life. The Pentagon described white phosphorus as a “chemical weapon” when it was used by Saddam Hussein against the Kurds, but has accepted uses of the substance in the past.

White phosphorus can cause injuries and death in three ways: by burning deep into tissue, by being inhaled as a smoke, and by being ingested. Extensive exposure by burning and ingestion may result in death. can cause injuries and death in three ways: by burning deep into tissue, by being inhaled as a smoke, and by being ingested. Extensive exposure by burning and ingestion may result in death. Phosphorus burns carry a greater risk of mortality than other forms of burns due to the absorption of phosphorus into the body through the burned area, resulting in liver, heart and kidney damage, and in some cases multiple organ failure.

It’s worth noting that the US have not yet made a statement on this allegation, however, few of the west’s mainstream news are even reporting it with a small mention in the New York Times, which are trying to sway opinion that this is no more than ISIS propaganda.

This is not an isolated case, the US and its Western allies continually fund it’s partners in murder across the Middle East to use these devastating chemical weapons. For a more detailed report on White Phosphorus and it’s continual use by the west visit our earlier report below:"
C01c5b,03/09/2015,conspiracy,"New study throws doubt on findings of safety in pesticide and GMO studies. Claire Robinson reports

Laboratory rodent feeds are highly contaminated with pesticides, toxic metals, PCBs, and GMOs, according to a new study soon to be published in the journal PLOS ONE.

The study casts doubt on claims of safety drawn from hundreds of thousands of animal feeding trials performed for regulatory approvals of pesticides and GMOs.

For the study, the team of Prof Gilles-Eric Séralini at the University of Caen in France analyzed the dried feed of laboratory animals sourced from 5 continents. These diets are commonly fed to rats used to test the safety of pesticides and GMOs. The study investigated 13 samples of rat feeds for traces of 262 pesticides, 4 heavy metals, 17 dioxins and furans, 18 PCBs and 22 GMOs.

The researchers found that all the feeds contained significant concentrations of several of these products at levels likely to cause diseases by disrupting the endocrine and nervous system of the animals. Considering all the contaminants measured, these diets, when consumed over a long-term experimental period, would be considered by standard measurements to pose a very high hazard to health.

For example, residues of glyphosate, used on 80% of GMO crops and widely used to “dry down” non-GMO crops before harvest, were detected in 9 of the 13 diets. Eleven of the 13 diets contained GMOs that are grown with large amounts of Roundup.

This is a problem for public health because regulators use tests on animals fed on these diets to assess the safety of any one pesticide or GMO by looking at the difference between the exposed animal and the controls. If the treatment (exposed) and control groups are both eating an uncontrolled assortment of pesticides or GMOs, any actual toxic effect arising from the pesticide or GMO under test, unless the effect is massive in size, will be lost amid the “noise” caused by the jumble of potentially and known toxic substances.

The upshot can be that regulators conclude that the pesticide or GMO under test is safe on the grounds that no significant difference is found between exposed and control groups, when in fact both groups are exposed to such a wide variety of toxins that their effects have drowned out any toxic effect from the pesticide or GMO being investigated."
C0282c,08/02/2017,conspiracy,"A Documentary to educate and help spread awareness about one of the most hated corporations in the World – Monsanto, aka Monsatan.

A quick history of Monsanto by The Waking Times:

1901: The company is founded by John Francis Queeny, a member of the Knights of Malta, a thirty year pharmaceutical veteran married to Olga Mendez Monsanto, for which Monsanto Chemical Works is named. The company’s first product is chemical saccharin, sold to Coca-Cola as an artificial sweetener.

1920s: Monsanto expands into industrial chemicals and drugs, becoming the world’s largest maker of aspirin, acetylsalicyclic acid, (toxic of course). This is also the time when things began to go horribly wrong for the planet in a hurry with the introduction of their polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

1930s: Created its first hybrid seed corn and expands into detergents, soaps, industrial cleaning products, synthetic rubbers and plastics. Oh yes, all toxic of course!

1940s: They begin research on uranium to be used for the Manhattan Project’s first atomic bomb, which would later be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands of Japanese, Korean and US Military servicemen and poisoning millions more.

1950s: Closely aligned with The Walt Disney Company, Monsanto creates several attractions at Disney’s Tomorrowland, espousing the glories of chemicals and plastics. Their “House of the Future” is constructed entirely of toxic plastic that is not biodegradable as they had asserted. What, Monsanto lied? I’m shocked!

1960s: Monsanto, along with chemical partner-in-crime DOW Chemical, produces dioxin-laced Agent Orange for use in the U.S.’s Vietnam invasion. The results? Over 3 million people contaminated, a half-million Vietnamese civilians dead, a half-million Vietnamese babies born with birth defects and thousands of U.S. military veterans suffering or dying from its effects to this day!

1970s: Monsanto partner, G.D. Searle, produces numerous internal studies which claim aspartame to be safe, while the FDA’s own scientific research clearly reveals that aspartame causes tumors and massive holes in the brains of rats, before killing them. The FDA initiates a grand jury investigation into G.D. Searle for “knowingly misrepresenting findings and concealing material facts and making false statements” in regard to aspartame safety.

1980s: Amid indisputable research that reveals the toxic effects of aspartame and as then FDA commissioner Dr. Jere Goyan was about to sign a petition into law keeping it off the market, Donald Rumsfeld calls Ronald Reagan for a favor the day after he takes office. Reagan fires the uncooperative Goyan and appoints Dr. Arthur Hayes Hull to head the FDA, who then quickly tips the scales in Searle’s favor and NutraSweet is approved for human consumption in dried products.This becomes sadly ironic since Reagan, a known jelly bean and candy enthusiast, later suffers from Alzheimers during his second term, one of the many horrific effects of aspartame consumption.

1990s: Monsanto spends millions defeating state and federal legislation that disallows the corporation from continuing to dump dioxins, pesticides and other cancer-causing poisons into drinking water systems. Regardless, they are sued countless times for causing disease in their plant workers, the people in surrounding areas and birth defects in babies.

2000s: By this time Monsanto controls the largest share of the global GMO market. In turn, the US gov’t spends hundreds of millions to fund aerial spraying of Roundup, causing massive environmental devastation. Fish and animals by the thousands die within days of spraying as respiratory ailments and cancer deaths in humans spike tremendously. But this is all considered an unusual coincidence so the spraying continues. If you thought Monsanto and the FDA were one and the same, well you can add the gov’t to that sorry list now."
C01efb,11/01/2019,conspiracy,"You may think this title was some clever ploy to get you interested in the article, clickbait so to speak, unfortunately, it’s not – in fact, the title doesn’t really do the subject justice as the truth is far more terrifying!

Back in May 2008, The Scientific American magazine published an article entitled ‘Mind Control by Cell Phone’ – Though the article mocks the idea that the technology would be used in such a way, it does reveal that mobile phones do produce mind-altering frequencies.

Technology moves on and with it so does malicious intent at attacking the human mind. It’s pretty hard to know the full extent of exactly how these new technologies are being used maliciously as just about all whistleblowers or people claiming to be ‘Cyber Security Experts‘ are ridiculed by the mainstream technology community.

But when you listen to many of these people and you discover some of the leaked information out there you soon become open to the possibility that something is going on.

Take this following information for example, Muckrock, a non-profit group that helps individuals file FIA requests, was attempting to dig up some information about the Washington State Fusion Center’s investigations into Antifa and white nationalists.

What they got sent was not what they expected and still to this day has no explanation what exactly the information implies, the archive they were sent was titled “EM effects on human body.zip”. The documents are about “psycho-electronic” weapons and “Remote Brain Mapping” devices.

There are three documents in the archive relating to reports of assessments made at the California State Threat Assessment Centre, these are of little interest, however, there are also three images which are rather interesting:

In this first image, it shows how using mobile phone network towers and mobile phones mind control can be achieved. It depicts the use of different methods to achieve both individual and group mind control via ‘Mobile Psychotronic Weapon carriers’.

In the second we are given how Psycho-Electronics can affect the human body. Some of the effects that can be caused are quite disturbing, including ‘Go here’ and ‘Go there’ commands, intense pain and forced Orgasm.

Finally, in this third image, it appears to be talking about the identification of objects including living creatures, specifically humans using electronic frequency transmission.

War is Fought Over The Airwaves

The days are gone where wars are fought over land and sea, nations are downsizing their military personal and rapidly increasing the number of hackers, programmers and scientists they have ‘fighting’ for them. The next major war will not be won by the nation with the largest guns, but by the nation with the greatest technologists onboard.

The following video is an interview with James Scott, now Scott has been largely ridiculed and pronounced as a fraud within the technology community and though I’d agree his history does seem somewhat scattered and his qualification for his current line of work is mostly self-appointed, this aside little of what he talks about is being debunked, in fact, much of what he talks about has been talked and written about for years by multiple other people.

Check out the video and make your own judgement, be sure to watch the second part of the video which will automatically play after the first one finished – Let us know what you think in the comments:

Whether you believe everything that self-proclaimed experts tell us or not, it would be irresponsible not to take precaution, some things we know for sure, they are not hidden, they are not secret, they are in the privacy t&c’s of every mobile app you install. Facebook tells you that they have full control over your camera and microphone for example, we generally press accept and carry on without a thought, but the implications of this are far-reaching.

Mind control is possible, experiments have been done openly and in secret for decades and the results are clear, the human mind can be controlled through a variety of techniques, with microwave frequencies being the most efficient.

It’s better to play safe and take simple precautions to protect yourself and your family, limit usage in children, if not for the reasons mentioned here in this article do it for the warping of your child’s social perception that social media causes. It’s no coincidence that since the introduction of Social media to youngsters the numbers of suicides and self-harming having grown exponentially.

Jonathan Haidt talks about this with Joe Rogan in a recent interview, some of the statistics will make you want to ban your children from using Social media forever:

Mind control via social Engineering is a far bigger problem right now than mind control via cell phone towers and microwave frequencies, however, as technology advances and the competition to win over your mind becomes more aggressive you can be sure that the latter will take over the former sometime in the future."
C023f6,04/05/2019,conspiracy,"A cellphone tower has been removed from the campus of a California elementary school after several cases of childhood Cancers have developed in students over the past year. The families affected at Weston Elementary School in Ripon claim the tower could have exposed their kids to harmful radiation. The cell tower provider, Sprint, have said the tower operates below the Government safety limits and is no threat to student safety. However, despite this, the cell tower has now been removed from campus.

Kellie Prime’s son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016.

“My son missed growing up with his friends. My son lost all of his hair. It’s not something that I wish on anybody to watch their child go through what our children have gone through.” 



Just five months later, Kyle’s friend and classmate, Mason Ferrulli, developed brain cancer, Mason’s mother, Monica Ferrulli said in an interview:

“Fourteen hours to get the tumour out and he had five weeks of inpatient rehabilitation. He had to learn to walk, talk, eat, everything all over again,”

Two more children at the school have since been diagnosed with cancer this year. 

 

“At what point are you saying, we gotta take a close look at the school here?” CBS News correspondent Carter Evans asked.

“The moment that I found out that Mason had been diagnosed… it popped into my mind that something was not OK,” Prime said. 

 

The mothers of the affected children believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radio frequency, or RF, waves coming from a cell tower located on the elementary school campus.

As noted by Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at UC Berkeley (an area that has taken a stricter stance on EMF awareness and safety), the U.S. Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC):

“Guidelines for cellphone radiation adopted in 1996 are outdated and were mostly based on work done by industry-paid scientists.”

And here lies the problem, as with so many other sectors with potential health concerns the industry is being monitored primarily by itself, those looking to make a profit are providing the studies to clear their own products of any health concerns – which is clearly a problem.

With 5G roll out now in place we can expect millions more of these potentially deadly cell towers popping up in our environment and in the case of 5G they didn’t even bother to do safety trials even though the technology is different to previous wireless internet transmission technologies:"
C05003,19/01/2020,conspiracy,"The Telecom’s Industry has got into the pockets of Government agencies yet again, this time with the ASA, the UK’s advertising authority. A recent advert by ‘Electrosensitivity UK‘ was swiftly banned from public advertising on claims by the ASA that the advert was providing false information:

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a “misleading” advert by campaign group Electrosensitivity-UK after it wrongfully claimed that the roll-out of ultrafast 5G mobile networks could result in a range of health effects, such as “reduced male fertility, depression, disturbed sleep and headaches, as well as cancer.”



 The advert itself took the form of a poster – seen in July and August 2019, which began with a headline that asked “How safe is 5G?” and featured four quotes from various “professionals” detailing their opposition to the roll-out of 5G (mobile broadband) network technology. [source]

The advert which was banned is shown below:

The headline “How safe is 5G?” appeared above an image of a family of three walking a dog across the street and blue-coloured contours which signified 5G radio waves. Alongside the four quotes in the ad was text which included “The 5G rollout is absolutely insane” and “The people are not guinea pigs whose health I can sell at a profit”, plus further text that set out a list of “Health effects”.



The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the ad that there was robust, scientific evidence that demonstrated negative human health effects caused by 5G signals. The advertiser therefore needed to hold robust evidence to that effect, including, but not limited to, longitudinal studies with human participants.

The WHO factsheet on “Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile phones”, which took account of several large completed and ongoing multinational epidemiological studies, including case-control studies and prospective cohort studies examining a number of health endpoints in adults, one of which was coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), determined that no adverse health effects had been established as being caused by mobile phone use. We noted the advertiser’s view that the factsheet was inaccurate. However, we considered the report formed that position based on extensive scientific examination and we understood that WHO, together with the IARC considered the available evidence fell short of being conclusive that exposure to all radio frequency radiation, of which mobile signals were a part, might cause cancer in humans. We noted that WHO were, at the time the ad was seen, conducting an ongoing project to assess potential health effects of exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields in the general and working population.

The UK Government’s guidance, which took account of the most up-to-date robust evidence from WHO, the Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) and the European Commission, had concluded that many exposure measurements had been made in the UK at publicly accessible locations near to base stations and that they had all been consistently well within the guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), recognised by WHO as an official collaborating non-governmental organisation whose aim was to protect people and the environment against adverse effects of non-ionising radiation.



 We assessed the material referred to by Electrosensitivity-UK in their submissions. We considered many of the articles and studies, such as the NTP study, were not adequate because they concerned animal experiments (such as mice, rats and rabbits), rather than studies which specifically examined human health. The NTP study also assessed 2G and 3G signals, and we understood that the NTP were still in the process of evaluating the 5G network. Many of the articles provided were not studies, but reviews of the current context of research in the area. One, for example, stated that the author was “very concerned that 5G may produce effects like those we already see produced from lower frequency EMFs but are much more severe”, but said that “the only way to find out is to do biological safety testing on genuine 5G radiation”, and concluded that “we have no risk analysis or risk management because we have no risk assessment whatsoever on 5G”. Another was a YouTube video of a Canadian radio talk show in which a scientist hypothesised the extinction of life forms due to 5G radiation. That material, along with many others, lacked the robustness of an appropriately designed observational study or clinical trial, and we therefore considered that it was insufficient to substantiate claims made about human health.

For the above reasons, we did not consider that the evidence demonstrated that 5G signals caused negative human health effects and therefore considered that the ad was misleading.

While the ASA do correctly state that much of the worries surrounding the dangers of 5G technology lack substantial studies, there is also no evidence whatsoever to ensure its safety, because not a single safety study has ever been done.

In there statement they also refereed to some exceptionally weak links regarding the dangers surrounding 5G and micro-wave radiation.

Maybe the next anti-5G advert should just simply state, ‘5G – There has been no safety studies’.

Of particular significance is the fact that SciAm is the oldest continuously published monthly magazine in the United States, founded by inventor and publisher Rufus M.

It is a highly influential publication, widely reputed for its rigorous scientific standards, and lauded by today’s fact-checkers as highly credible and staunchly pro-science.

In the article, University of California, Berkeley public health researcher Joel M. Moskowitz argues that 5G, along with previous wi-fi and cellular technology, is much more harmful than the government and telecom industry wants the public to believe.

His primary concerns center around a recent FCC announcement, made in a press release, that the FCC is close to reaffirming the radio frequency radiation (RFR) exposure limits that were previously adopted by the commission in the 1990’s… well before the introduction of 5G, 4G, 3G, 2G or even WiFi.

In short, the safety standards that the FCC wishes to maintain are severely outdated and fail to reflect the growing body of scientific evidence demonstrating harm.

Moskowitz notes that the ’90’s exposure limits only address the singular concern over the potential effects of the intensity of exposure to RFR. With the research we now have available the health concerns are much broader, including a sincere risk of cancer, among other things.
• The Not So ‘Great Reset’

“The latest cellular technology, 5G, will employ millimeter waves for the first time in addition to microwaves that have been in use for older cellular technologies, 2G through 4G. Given limited reach, 5G will require cell antennas every 100 to 200 meters, exposing many people to millimeter wave radiation. 5G also employs new technologies (e.g., active antennas capable of beam-forming; phased arrays; massive multiple inputs and outputs, known as massive MIMO) which pose unique challenges for measuring exposures.

Millimeter waves are mostly absorbed within a few millimeters of human skin and in the surface layers of the cornea. Short-term exposure can have adverse physiological effects in the peripheral nervous system, the immune system and the cardiovascular system. The research suggests that long-term exposure may pose health risks to the skin (e.g., melanoma), the eyes (e.g., ocular melanoma) and the testes (e.g., sterility).

The FCC’s RFR exposure limits regulate the intensity of exposure, taking into account the frequency of the carrier waves, but ignore the signaling properties of the RFR. Along with the patterning and duration of exposures, certain characteristics of the signal (e.g., pulsing, polarization) increase the biologic and health impacts of the exposure. New exposure limits are needed which account for these differential effects. Moreover, these limits should be based on a biological effect, not a change in a laboratory rat’s behavior.” ~Joel M. Moskowitz, Scientific American

Moskowitz also cites the the International EMF Scientist Appeal, which elaborates on the now-known dangerous effects of RFR:

“Numerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines. Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plant and animal life.” [Source]

Moskowitz points out that,”the scientists who signed this appeal arguably constitute the majority of experts on the effects of nonionizing radiation. They have published more than 2,000 papers and letters on EMF in professional journals.” Inviting readers and policy makers to consider the weight of more than 500 peer-reviewed research studies finding, “harmful biologic or health effects from exposure to RFR at intensities too low to cause significant heating,” Moskowitz believes that more rigorous studies are necessary before the rollout goes forward.

In other words, the scientific jury is already out on the harmful effects of RFR, and the FCC is flat-out derelict in its duty to put public safety above telecomm industry interests.

Regarding the propaganda dimension of this debate, Moskowitz addresses the fact that industry spokepersons and related government officials frequently refer to contrarian viewpoints as ‘fear-mongering,’ pointing out that the current scientific research is legitimate, leaving the scientific community with a genuine responsibility to speak out about these concerns.

“The telecommunications industry and their experts have accused many scientists who have researched the effects of cell phone radiation of “fear mongering” over the advent of wireless technology’s 5G. Since much of our research is publicly-funded, we believe it is our ethical responsibility to inform the public about what the peer-reviewed scientific literature tells us about the health risks from wireless radiation.” ~ Joel M.
